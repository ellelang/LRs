#### Points Collection





-  In all these areas the most widely used method to model choice among mutually exclusive alternatives has been the **Conditional or Multinomial Logit model (MNL)** ( McFad-den 1974 ), which belongs to the family of Random Utility Maximization (RUM) models.  

- The most popular MNL extension is the Mixed Logit Model (MIXL). MIXL allows parameters to vary randomly over individuals by assuming some continuous heterogeneity distribution a priori while keeping the MNL assumption that the error term is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) extreme value type 1.

  - using  the  parametric  heterogeneity distribution  that  describes  how  preferences  vary  in  the  population  it  is  possible  to  derive conditional estimates of the parameters at the individual-level
