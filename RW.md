### Template collection



The remainder of this article is organized as follows. In the following section, we give an overview of the theory, looking first at closed-form GEV models, and then at mixed GEV models. Section 3 presents a summary of the empirical analysis conducted to explore the potential of mixed GEV models and to highlight the issues of confounding discussed above. Finally, the fourth section gives a summary of the findings and presents the conclusions of the research.
