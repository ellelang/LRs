## 1. Who cares? Making sentence meaning for your readers

## 2. Conjunctions that kill: Subordination

Subordinating conjunctions are a much larger set. They include *after, although, as, because, before, if, since, than, though, unless, until, when, and while.*

A lot of common phrases serve as subordinating conjunctions as well. They include *as long as, as though, even if, even though, in order that, and whether or not.*

These subordinators all have one thing in common: They subordinate. They relegate information to less critical status. They tell the Reader, *“This is just minor info we have to get out of the way before we get to the really big news” or “We’re tacking this on as an afterthought to really big news.”*

Consider this sentence:

- Before robbing a bank, Mike was an accountant 

V.S.

- After working for twenty-five years as an accountant, Mike robbed a bank.

Subordinating conjunctions relegate clauses to a lower grammatical status. Subordination means that what was a whole sentence is whole no more. It’s a mere subordinate clause. This is why subordinate clauses are often called dependent clauses: they depend on another clause to make the sentence complete. 

Your Reader instinctively knows that a subordinate clause is less important than the main clause that’s sure to come up somewhere in your sentence. Remember that little rant about thy Reader, thy god? **That’s your guiding light here: what does your Reader most want to know?**

- The company resumed regular operations after its president failed to acquire a competing firm.

We have two actions in this sentence: a resuming of operations and a failed attempt to acquire a company. One is a big event. The other is a return to business as usual. If the failed acquisition is most notable to the reader, take that out of the subordinate clause:

- The company’s president failed to acquire a competing firm. After the deal fell through, the company resumed regular operations.

This illustrates that subordination is not a bad thing. It’s a tool. It only becomes a bad thing when you subordinate the stuff most interesting to your Reader while elevating less important information. Let’s look at another example

- Until Jane can slay the dragon, retrieve the jewel from its belly, and bribe the evil King Goombah, her mission of protecting her townsfolk will remain unfulfilled.

A sentence like this might be okay after you’ve already discussed the slaying, jewel-getting, and bribing business. But unless you’ve already fleshed out these details for your Reader, you’re throwing a wet blanket on some interesting action. Once you’re aware of the power of subordination, a whole world of options opens up to you:

- Jane must slay the dragon. Then she must cut the fabled jewel out of its belly and deliver it to the evil King Goombah. It’s the only way she can stop the massacre of her townsfolk.

Now that you’re getting the hang of this, here’s a more subtle example:

- If I’m going to give you ten million dollars, you must use it wisely.

This is not a bad sentence. *If* clauses set up conditions, which can be crucial to your meaning. But because our **if** clause contains the most interesting stuff—a ten-million-dollar gift—it’s worth considering whether we can play up that information:

- I’m going to give you ten million dollars if and only if you’ll use it wisely.

Your goal is to start to recognize subordinating conjunctions in your writing and in your reading—to see the power they afford you to serve your Reader. These words help you organize your thoughts, say what you mean, emphasize what’s most important, and even create art. If that takes a while, it’s time well spent.

## 3. Movable objects: Understanding phrases and clauses

A clause is a unit that usually contains a subject and a verb.
A phrase is a single word or a cluster of words that together work in your sentence as a single part of speech. As we have seen, phrases come in five varieties: noun phrases, verb phrases, adverb phrases, adjective phrases, and prepositional phrases

Every phrase has a headword—the word on which any other words are hinged



Has danced is a verb phrase. It contains the **auxiliary** has and the **past participle** danced. Together, they convey the action and when it occurred.

With is a **preposition**. We’ll talk more about prepositions in chapter 9.
But for now, remember that these include words like with, of, to, at, in,
above, before, and so on.  It’s crucial to note that a preposition takes an object—usually a noun phrase. Together, they’re our prepositional phrase. Note that the object of a preposition could also be a **pronoun**: with her.

verbs and prepositions are the only two parts of speech that do this. But not all verbs do. The ones that do are called **transitive**.

Who was wearing Spanx is a relative clause. It’s a modifier, which means it works like an adjective, adding extra description to the noun that comes before it: woman.

You just need to begin to identify phrases and clauses in your reading and writing. Start looking for them, especially prepositional phrases, which can be the most helpful to a writer and also the most fun, as we’ll see in chapter 9. Until then, suffice it to say that
prepositional phrases are the key to fully enjoying the supposedly real
classified advertisement that once offered for sale “mixing bowl set
designed to please cook with round bottom for efficient beating”!

Stop! is a complete clause and even a complete sentence because, in English, commands—called **imperatives**—drop the subject, which is you:

## 4. Size matters: Short versus Long Sentences

- Alec Baldwin has the unbending, straight-armed gait of someone
  trying to prevent clothes from rubbing against sunburned skin.
- Alec Baldwin, who stars in 30 Rock, the NBC sitcom that has
  revived his career and done nothing to lift his spirits, has the
  unbending, straight-armed gait of someone trying to prevent clothes from rubbing against sunburned skin.

Personally, I have a strong bias in favor of short sentences.  But the second sentence carries some unique benefits. It shakes up the Reader by defying conventional form. As such, it has an ability to command attention that the shorter version does not. Further, some of the inserted stuff actually bolsters the point of the sentence. In particular, the fact that Baldwin’s successful show has done nothing to lift his spirits is both relevant and juicy. It gives further insight into why this guy might walk around as though he’s trying not to rub a sunburn. And though we could find plenty wrong with the real New Yorker sentence, it’s actually quite skillful and effective.



Compare two more examples and you’ll see why, in general, I’m biased
toward shorter sentences:

- I killed him even though I didn’t want to because he gave me no choice.
- I killed him. I didn’t want to. He gave me no choice.

In I killed him even though I didn’t want to because he gave me no choice, the linking terms even though and because seem mealy mouthed. It’s like the writer is scrambling to explain herself, speaking from a weak, pleading position. It’s almost ironic how the facts stand stronger when they stand alone, unmitigated by the writer’s urge to overexplain: I killed him. I didn’t want to. He gave me no choice.



I believe that modern sensibilities are more attuned to short sentences. Media culture is partly responsible. Think about it. We spend countless hours listening to thirty-second TV commercials that contain six, eight, ten sentences each. But we know that most of the words are just filler. Each commercial has only one central message that boils down into one sentence: “Windex doesn’t leave streaks.” “Drive a Mustang and you’ll be popular with the ladies.” “If you really love your kids, you’ll buy Purell hand sanitizer.” The central message is supplemented with extra sentences used to hammer home the same point. As a culture, we’re becoming ever more inclined to **tune out fluff**. **Stripped-down-bare information is an anomaly that can command our attention and our respect.**

Still, anyone who tells you straight out that short sentences are superior is either overlooking or discounting some of the most respected writers of all time.
So, then, what’s the verdict? Are short sentences better or not?
Allow me to end this debate once and for all. Here’s how you should
look at it: Brevity is a tool. It’s a very powerful tool. You don’t have to use it. But you have to know how. If you’re going to use long sentences, it should be by choice, not due to bumbling ineptitude. Every long sentence can be broken up into shorter ones, and if you don’t know how—if you don’t see within your long sentences groupings of simple, clear ideas—it will show.

You should master the art of the short sentence, even if you prefer
longer ones. All you have to do is start looking at every sentence as a
group of phrases and clauses. See in each sentence how every bit of information could carry a sentence of its own. Then you’ll have the power to decide exactly how to organize your information.

Let's practice:

- Job hunters read and hear all the time that it’s not always enough
  simply to be qualified for a job because, if other qualified candidates are pursuing and competing for the same vacancy, how well you distinguish yourself from the competition is also critical to getting hired.

Now let’s separate some of the bits of information in this sentence. For this breakdown, we’re not looking for clauses but for all the individual ideas in the sentence:

- There is something that job hunters frequently hear.

- It is also something they frequently read.
- Being qualified for a job isn’t always enough to land a job.
- Other candidates may be pursuing the same vacancy.
- Other candidates may be competing for the same vacancy.
- Distinguishing yourself is critical to getting hired.

Do you see unnecessary information in here? Is it really important to
note that job hunters hear and read this? Why stop there? Why not say they hear and read and sniff out and deduce and realize and innately understand and feel with their fingertips while reading Braille and any other activity that conveys information to your brain? No doubt, the writer believed she’d be remiss if she overlooked the fact that job seekers both read and hear it. **My advice: Be remiss. It’s okay to just say, “They hear it all the time,” as long as your Reader understands. There’s no need to include a laundry list of all the ways that a job seeker might encounter the information.**

Another bit of unnecessary information in our sentence is that business about other candidates pursuing and competing for the same vacancy. Even more than the see and read stuff, this is a major duh. Pursuing the same vacancy means competing. Also, how is competing for the same job different from competing for the job? The word compete already suggests that it’s the same job. Adding the word same creates a redundancy on top of the redundancy pursuing and competing for. So, what would you do with our original Franken sentence? The possibilities are infinite. Here, slightly disguised, is what I did:

Job hunters ~~read  and~~ hear <u>it</u> all the time ~~that~~: It’s not always
enough ~~simply~~ to be qualified for a job. ~~~~because if other qualified~~
~~candidates are pursuing and competing for the same vacancy, how~~
well~~ You <u>need to</u> distinguish yourself from the competition ~~is also~~
~~critical to getting hired.~~



By the way, don’t feel bad if your sentences come out long and
rambling at first. For many people, that’s just part of the writing process. I write some major stinkers myself. It doesn’t mean you’re a bad writer or you lack talent. It just means that your process for writing good sentences involves putting your messy ideas on paper before cleaning them up. I suppose some people organize all their thoughts in their head before putting them on paper. Kudos to them. But it doesn’t mean they’re necessarily better writers. There’s nothing wrong with writing sentences that come out clunky at first, as long as you can reread your own writing and see where revisions could make your sentences better.

Let’s analyze another sentence. This one’s a little trickier than the last.
It’s based on a real but unpublished sentence by a professional writer:

- In addition to assisting her with the practical aspects of returning
  to school (such as writing a successful application essay and
  obtaining financial aid), Elizabeth, the center’s advisor, who was
  always quick with a smile and a word of encouragement, helped Rona address her feelings of self-doubt, uncertainty, and  apprehensiveness.

What to do, then, about this monstrous sentence? Often, the simplest
solution is to just drop all the conjunctions and fillers and parentheses and other connecting devices and make simple sentences out of what’s left. That is, isolate the clauses and/or distinct ideas and form them into individual sentences:

- Elizabeth assisted Rona with the practical aspects of returning to school. She helped Rona write an application essay and apply for
  financial aid. Elizabeth was the center’s advisor. She was always
  quick with a smile or a word of encouragement. She helped Rona
  address her feelings of self-doubt, uncertainty, and apprehensiveness.

Now we can see that the very essence of our bad sentence was actually a cluster of clear, simple ideas that can be expressed clearly and simply. The beauty of boiling it down this way is that now you can make more choices.

Personally, I’d go for a clear, no-frills rewrite like this:

Elizabeth, the center’s advisor, assisted Rona with the practical
aspects of returning to school (14). She helped Rona write an application essay and apply for financial aid (12). Always quick with a smile or a word of encouragement, Elizabeth also helped Rona address her feelings of self-doubt and apprehensiveness (21).

There’s no single right answer. And again, every rewrite contains the
**danger** of lost meaning or lost information or even the possibility you’ll make the sentence factually incorrect. So while reworking for clarity, the writer must always **keep a tight rein on** accuracy and meaning.

If it helps, divide writing into two categories: craft and art. If you’re
plying the craft of writing, aim to make many of your sentences short.
Note the word many. Even the most hard-nosed short-sentence advocate will agree that too many short sentences strung together can be downright droning. Mixing short sentences with long ones can make your writing more rhythmically pleasing and therefore more Reader friendly. Writers of business letters, press releases, nonfiction books, genre novels—anyone who is more interested in content than form—usually fall into this writing as-craft category in which short sentences are probably a virtue.

If, on the other hand, you’re shooting for art, all bets are off. Art and
beauty, more so than clarity and expediency, are in the eye of the **beholder**. If you think you can write an eighty-nine-word sentence that creates for your Reader a better experience than would a **ten- or fifteen-word sentence,** do. Go nuts. But remember, short sentences can be art, too. Any fan of Hemingway can tell you that. McCarthy himself is proof:

- He squatted and watched it. He could smell the smoke.
- He wet his finger and held it to the wind.

McCarthy uses plenty of short sentences, as this excerpt from The Road illustrates. He’s even into sentence fragments and uses them to great effect. His range proves my point: only someone who can see ideas in their most **pared-down** form can begin stringing them together in ways that make an outrageously long sentence work.
