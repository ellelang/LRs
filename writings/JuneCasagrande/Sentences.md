# It was the best sentences, it was the worst sentences

## 1. Who cares? Making sentence meaning for your readers

## 2. Conjunctions that kill: Subordination

Subordinating conjunctions are a much larger set. They include *after, although, as, because, before, if, since, than, though, unless, until, when, and while.*

A lot of common phrases serve as subordinating conjunctions as well. They include *as long as, as though, even if, even though, in order that, and whether or not.*

These subordinators all have one thing in common: They subordinate. They relegate information to less critical status. They tell the Reader, *“This is just minor info we have to get out of the way before we get to the really big news” or “We’re tacking this on as an afterthought to really big news.”*

Consider this sentence:

- Before robbing a bank, Mike was an accountant 

V.S.

- After working for twenty-five years as an accountant, Mike robbed a bank.

Subordinating conjunctions relegate clauses to a lower grammatical status. Subordination means that what was a whole sentence is whole no more. It’s a mere subordinate clause. This is why subordinate clauses are often called dependent clauses: they depend on another clause to make the sentence complete. 

Your Reader instinctively knows that a subordinate clause is less important than the main clause that’s sure to come up somewhere in your sentence. Remember that little rant about thy Reader, thy god? **That’s your guiding light here: what does your Reader most want to know?**

- The company resumed regular operations after its president failed to acquire a competing firm.

We have two actions in this sentence: a resuming of operations and a failed attempt to acquire a company. One is a big event. The other is a return to business as usual. If the failed acquisition is most notable to the reader, take that out of the subordinate clause:

- The company’s president failed to acquire a competing firm. After the deal fell through, the company resumed regular operations.

This illustrates that subordination is not a bad thing. It’s a tool. It only becomes a bad thing when you subordinate the stuff most interesting to your Reader while elevating less important information. Let’s look at another example

- Until Jane can slay the dragon, retrieve the jewel from its belly, and bribe the evil King Goombah, her mission of protecting her townsfolk will remain unfulfilled.

A sentence like this might be okay after you’ve already discussed the slaying, jewel-getting, and bribing business. But unless you’ve already fleshed out these details for your Reader, you’re throwing a wet blanket on some interesting action. Once you’re aware of the power of subordination, a whole world of options opens up to you:

- Jane must slay the dragon. Then she must cut the fabled jewel out of its belly and deliver it to the evil King Goombah. It’s the only way she can stop the massacre of her townsfolk.

Now that you’re getting the hang of this, here’s a more subtle example:

- If I’m going to give you ten million dollars, you must use it wisely.

This is not a bad sentence. *If* clauses set up conditions, which can be crucial to your meaning. But because our **if** clause contains the most interesting stuff—a ten-million-dollar gift—it’s worth considering whether we can play up that information:

- I’m going to give you ten million dollars if and only if you’ll use it wisely.

Your goal is to start to recognize subordinating conjunctions in your writing and in your reading—to see the power they afford you to serve your Reader. These words help you organize your thoughts, say what you mean, emphasize what’s most important, and even create art. If that takes a while, it’s time well spent.
