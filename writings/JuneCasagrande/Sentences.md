## 1. Who cares? Making sentence meaning for your readers

## 2. Conjunctions that kill: Subordination

Subordinating conjunctions are a much larger set. They include *after, although, as, because, before, if, since, than, though, unless, until, when, and while.*

A lot of common phrases serve as subordinating conjunctions as well. They include *as long as, as though, even if, even though, in order that, and whether or not.*

These subordinators all have one thing in common: They subordinate. They relegate information to less critical status. They tell the Reader, *“This is just minor info we have to get out of the way before we get to the really big news” or “We’re tacking this on as an afterthought to really big news.”*

Consider this sentence:

- Before robbing a bank, Mike was an accountant 

V.S.

- After working for twenty-five years as an accountant, Mike robbed a bank.

Subordinating conjunctions relegate clauses to a lower grammatical status. Subordination means that what was a whole sentence is whole no more. It’s a mere subordinate clause. This is why subordinate clauses are often called dependent clauses: they depend on another clause to make the sentence complete. 

Your Reader instinctively knows that a subordinate clause is less important than the main clause that’s sure to come up somewhere in your sentence. Remember that little rant about thy Reader, thy god? **That’s your guiding light here: what does your Reader most want to know?**

- The company resumed regular operations after its president failed to acquire a competing firm.

We have two actions in this sentence: a resuming of operations and a failed attempt to acquire a company. One is a big event. The other is a return to business as usual. If the failed acquisition is most notable to the reader, take that out of the subordinate clause:

- The company’s president failed to acquire a competing firm. After the deal fell through, the company resumed regular operations.

This illustrates that subordination is not a bad thing. It’s a tool. It only becomes a bad thing when you subordinate the stuff most interesting to your Reader while elevating less important information. Let’s look at another example

- Until Jane can slay the dragon, retrieve the jewel from its belly, and bribe the evil King Goombah, her mission of protecting her townsfolk will remain unfulfilled.

A sentence like this might be okay after you’ve already discussed the slaying, jewel-getting, and bribing business. But unless you’ve already fleshed out these details for your Reader, you’re throwing a wet blanket on some interesting action. Once you’re aware of the power of subordination, a whole world of options opens up to you:

- Jane must slay the dragon. Then she must cut the fabled jewel out of its belly and deliver it to the evil King Goombah. It’s the only way she can stop the massacre of her townsfolk.

Now that you’re getting the hang of this, here’s a more subtle example:

- If I’m going to give you ten million dollars, you must use it wisely.

This is not a bad sentence. *If* clauses set up conditions, which can be crucial to your meaning. But because our **if** clause contains the most interesting stuff—a ten-million-dollar gift—it’s worth considering whether we can play up that information:

- I’m going to give you ten million dollars if and only if you’ll use it wisely.

Your goal is to start to recognize subordinating conjunctions in your writing and in your reading—to see the power they afford you to serve your Reader. These words help you organize your thoughts, say what you mean, emphasize what’s most important, and even create art. If that takes a while, it’s time well spent.

## 3. Movable objects: Understanding phrases and clauses

A clause is a unit that usually contains a subject and a verb.
A phrase is a single word or a cluster of words that together work in your sentence as a single part of speech. As we have seen, phrases come in five varieties: noun phrases, verb phrases, adverb phrases, adjective phrases, and prepositional phrases

Every phrase has a headword—the word on which any other words are hinged



Has danced is a verb phrase. It contains the **auxiliary** has and the **past participle** danced. Together, they convey the action and when it occurred.

With is a **preposition**. We’ll talk more about prepositions in chapter 9.
But for now, remember that these include words like with, of, to, at, in,
above, before, and so on.  It’s crucial to note that a preposition takes an object—usually a noun phrase. Together, they’re our prepositional phrase. Note that the object of a preposition could also be a **pronoun**: with her.

verbs and prepositions are the only two parts of speech that do this. But not all verbs do. The ones that do are called **transitive**.

Who was wearing Spanx is a relative clause. It’s a modifier, which means it works like an adjective, adding extra description to the noun that comes before it: woman.

You just need to begin to identify phrases and clauses in your reading and writing. Start looking for them, especially prepositional phrases, which can be the most helpful to a writer and also the most fun, as we’ll see in chapter 9. Until then, suffice it to say that
prepositional phrases are the key to fully enjoying the supposedly real
classified advertisement that once offered for sale “mixing bowl set
designed to please cook with round bottom for efficient beating”!

Stop! is a complete clause and even a complete sentence because, in English, commands—called **imperatives**—drop the subject, which is you:

## 4. Size matters: Short versus Long Sentences

- Alec Baldwin has the unbending, straight-armed gait of someone
  trying to prevent clothes from rubbing against sunburned skin.
- Alec Baldwin, who stars in 30 Rock, the NBC sitcom that has
  revived his career and done nothing to lift his spirits, has the
  unbending, straight-armed gait of someone trying to prevent clothes from rubbing against sunburned skin.

Personally, I have a strong bias in favor of short sentences.  But the second sentence carries some unique benefits. It shakes up the Reader by defying conventional form. As such, it has an ability to command attention that the shorter version does not. Further, some of the inserted stuff actually bolsters the point of the sentence. In particular, the fact that Baldwin’s successful show has done nothing to lift his spirits is both relevant and juicy. It gives further insight into why this guy might walk around as though he’s trying not to rub a sunburn. And though we could find plenty wrong with the real New Yorker sentence, it’s actually quite skillful and effective.



Compare two more examples and you’ll see why, in general, I’m biased
toward shorter sentences:

- I killed him even though I didn’t want to because he gave me no choice.
- I killed him. I didn’t want to. He gave me no choice.

In I killed him even though I didn’t want to because he gave me no choice, the linking terms even though and because seem mealy mouthed. It’s like the writer is scrambling to explain herself, speaking from a weak, pleading position. It’s almost ironic how the facts stand stronger when they stand alone, unmitigated by the writer’s urge to overexplain: I killed him. I didn’t want to. He gave me no choice.



I believe that modern sensibilities are more attuned to short sentences. Media culture is partly responsible. Think about it. We spend countless hours listening to thirty-second TV commercials that contain six, eight, ten sentences each. But we know that most of the words are just filler. Each commercial has only one central message that boils down into one sentence: “Windex doesn’t leave streaks.” “Drive a Mustang and you’ll be popular with the ladies.” “If you really love your kids, you’ll buy Purell hand sanitizer.” The central message is supplemented with extra sentences used to hammer home the same point. As a culture, we’re becoming ever more inclined to **tune out fluff**. **Stripped-down-bare information is an anomaly that can command our attention and our respect.**

Still, anyone who tells you straight out that short sentences are superior is either overlooking or discounting some of the most respected writers of all time.
So, then, what’s the verdict? Are short sentences better or not?
Allow me to end this debate once and for all. Here’s how you should
look at it: Brevity is a tool. It’s a very powerful tool. You don’t have to use it. But you have to know how. If you’re going to use long sentences, it should be by choice, not due to bumbling ineptitude. Every long sentence can be broken up into shorter ones, and if you don’t know how—if you don’t see within your long sentences groupings of simple, clear ideas—it will show.

You should master the art of the short sentence, even if you prefer
longer ones. All you have to do is start looking at every sentence as a
group of phrases and clauses. See in each sentence how every bit of information could carry a sentence of its own. Then you’ll have the power to decide exactly how to organize your information.

Let's practice:

- Job hunters read and hear all the time that it’s not always enough
  simply to be qualified for a job because, if other qualified candidates are pursuing and competing for the same vacancy, how well you distinguish yourself from the competition is also critical to getting hired.

Now let’s separate some of the bits of information in this sentence. For this breakdown, we’re not looking for clauses but for all the individual ideas in the sentence:

- There is something that job hunters frequently hear.

- It is also something they frequently read.
- Being qualified for a job isn’t always enough to land a job.
- Other candidates may be pursuing the same vacancy.
- Other candidates may be competing for the same vacancy.
- Distinguishing yourself is critical to getting hired.

Do you see unnecessary information in here? Is it really important to
note that job hunters hear and read this? Why stop there? Why not say they hear and read and sniff out and deduce and realize and innately understand and feel with their fingertips while reading Braille and any other activity that conveys information to your brain? No doubt, the writer believed she’d be remiss if she overlooked the fact that job seekers both read and hear it. **My advice: Be remiss. It’s okay to just say, “They hear it all the time,” as long as your Reader understands. There’s no need to include a laundry list of all the ways that a job seeker might encounter the information.**

Another bit of unnecessary information in our sentence is that business about other candidates pursuing and competing for the same vacancy. Even more than the see and read stuff, this is a major duh. Pursuing the same vacancy means competing. Also, how is competing for the same job different from competing for the job? The word compete already suggests that it’s the same job. Adding the word same creates a redundancy on top of the redundancy pursuing and competing for. So, what would you do with our original Franken sentence? The possibilities are infinite. Here, slightly disguised, is what I did:

Job hunters ~~read  and~~ hear <u>it</u> all the time ~~that~~: It’s not always
enough ~~simply~~ to be qualified for a job. ~~~~because if other qualified~~
~~candidates are pursuing and competing for the same vacancy, how~~
well~~ You <u>need to</u> distinguish yourself from the competition ~~is also~~
~~critical to getting hired.~~



By the way, don’t feel bad if your sentences come out long and
rambling at first. For many people, that’s just part of the writing process. I write some major stinkers myself. It doesn’t mean you’re a bad writer or you lack talent. It just means that your process for writing good sentences involves putting your messy ideas on paper before cleaning them up. I suppose some people organize all their thoughts in their head before putting them on paper. Kudos to them. But it doesn’t mean they’re necessarily better writers. There’s nothing wrong with writing sentences that come out clunky at first, as long as you can reread your own writing and see where revisions could make your sentences better.

Let’s analyze another sentence. This one’s a little trickier than the last.
It’s based on a real but unpublished sentence by a professional writer:

- In addition to assisting her with the practical aspects of returning
  to school (such as writing a successful application essay and
  obtaining financial aid), Elizabeth, the center’s advisor, who was
  always quick with a smile and a word of encouragement, helped Rona address her feelings of self-doubt, uncertainty, and  apprehensiveness.

What to do, then, about this monstrous sentence? Often, the simplest
solution is to just drop all the conjunctions and fillers and parentheses and other connecting devices and make simple sentences out of what’s left. That is, isolate the clauses and/or distinct ideas and form them into individual sentences:

- Elizabeth assisted Rona with the practical aspects of returning to school. She helped Rona write an application essay and apply for
  financial aid. Elizabeth was the center’s advisor. She was always
  quick with a smile or a word of encouragement. She helped Rona
  address her feelings of self-doubt, uncertainty, and apprehensiveness.

Now we can see that the very essence of our bad sentence was actually a cluster of clear, simple ideas that can be expressed clearly and simply. The beauty of boiling it down this way is that now you can make more choices.

Personally, I’d go for a clear, no-frills rewrite like this:

Elizabeth, the center’s advisor, assisted Rona with the practical
aspects of returning to school (14). She helped Rona write an application essay and apply for financial aid (12). Always quick with a smile or a word of encouragement, Elizabeth also helped Rona address her feelings of self-doubt and apprehensiveness (21).

There’s no single right answer. And again, every rewrite contains the
**danger** of lost meaning or lost information or even the possibility you’ll make the sentence factually incorrect. So while reworking for clarity, the writer must always **keep a tight rein on** accuracy and meaning.

If it helps, divide writing into two categories: craft and art. If you’re
plying the craft of writing, aim to make many of your sentences short.
Note the word many. Even the most hard-nosed short-sentence advocate will agree that too many short sentences strung together can be downright droning. Mixing short sentences with long ones can make your writing more rhythmically pleasing and therefore more Reader friendly. Writers of business letters, press releases, nonfiction books, genre novels—anyone who is more interested in content than form—usually fall into this writing as-craft category in which short sentences are probably a virtue.

If, on the other hand, you’re shooting for art, all bets are off. Art and
beauty, more so than clarity and expediency, are in the eye of the **beholder**. If you think you can write an eighty-nine-word sentence that creates for your Reader a better experience than would a **ten- or fifteen-word sentence,** do. Go nuts. But remember, short sentences can be art, too. Any fan of Hemingway can tell you that. McCarthy himself is proof:

- He squatted and watched it. He could smell the smoke.
- He wet his finger and held it to the wind.

McCarthy uses plenty of short sentences, as this excerpt from The Road illustrates. He’s even into sentence fragments and uses them to great effect. His range proves my point: only someone who can see ideas in their most **pared-down** form can begin stringing them together in ways that make an outrageously long sentence work.



## 5. Words gone wild: Sentences that say nothing-or worse



Pay attention to your words. Try not to zone out or become
hypnotized by the clichés that live in all our heads and that try to slip into everyone’s writing. When you reread your writing, try to do so with a scrutinizing eye that asks, is there a better way to nail down what I really mean?



## 6. Words gone wild: Choosing specific words over vague ones

Words like structure and items and person usually have no business in
your sentences. They’re just wispy shadows of the things they’re trying to represent. Ask yourself whether there’s a more concrete word that can create a more real experience for your Reader. Sometimes, the answer will be no. But often you’ll find that there are much better alternatives to these opaque words. Whatever you do, don’t let laziness or cowardice dictate your word
choices.

Not every sentence needs to be packed with details and descriptors. But learning to pinpoint and root out vague words will give you more choices and therefore more power to construct the best sentence for your piece and for your Reader.

## 7. A frequently overstated case: The truth about adverbs

It is, perhaps, the most famous bit of sentence-writing advice of all
time: avoid adverbs. Yet I’d guess that about nine out of ten people who spout this advice would flunk the following test. Find all the adverbs in this sentence: 

- Knowing well that I can visit you there soon is not really very
  helpful, as I am not well and therefore cannot prudently travel
  tomorrow.

That’s right, there are eight—count ’em, eight—adverbs in this
sentence. They are well (the first but not the second one), there, soon,
really, very, therefore, prudently, and tomorrow. Yep, this tomorrow is an adverb. Don’t believe me? Look it up in your dictionary. I’ll wait.

When people say that adverbs hurt writing, they’re talking about a
specific kind of adverb, called a manner adverb—even though they may not realize it. Manner adverbs are the ones that describe the manner in which an action occurred: walk quickly, eat slowly, dance enthusiastically. When people say to avoid them, there’s some wisdom in their advice, but only for those wise enough to understand it.

Think of an adverbial as any unit doing an adverb’s job: answering
when, where, or in what manner, or modifying a whole thought. Adverbs can modify verbs (Mark whistles happily), adjectives (Betty is
extremely tall), other adverbs (Mark whistles extremely happily), or whole sentences (However, I don’t care).

Full mastery of adverbs takes time and, frankly, isn’t necessary for our
goal of writing good sentences. But there are three things you should
remember about adverbs:

1. Adverbs are a very broad group that includes those -ly words we
all learned, but also many other types of words. To identify
adverbs, think of them as words that answer the questions when,
where, how, to what degree, and in what manner. When in
doubt, check a dictionary. Better yet, check two or three.
2. When someone tells a writer to avoid adverbs, the speaker
really means avoid manner adverbs—the ones that answer the
questions in what manner and to what degree.
3. Adverbials can be single words or whole phrases that inject
    when-, where-, or how-type information into your sentence (I’ll
    exercise on Monday) or offer commentary on the whole
    sentence: Tragically, Jonas was fired. In consequence, he found
    a new job.

Let’s look at another example:

- People who aren’t happy in their jobs may be more likely to stay
  with their current employers than look for new ones because they see so many Americans involuntarily losing their jobs.

This sentence is from a piece by a professional columnist, which proves that even the best of us can encounter adverb problems. **Involuntarily losing their jobs, in this sentence at least, is not one iota different from just plain old losing their jobs**. The Reader gets the message and doesn’t need to be told that getting canned is involuntary.

When we eliminate the adverb, we take out a redundancy. But we also
streamline the sentence for some less-is-more value:

- because they see so many Americans losing their jobs.

**This is a sentence-level microcosm of that most iconic bit of writing advice: show, don’t tell. Job loss is a thing. The Reader can see it for what it is. He doesn’t need it gussied up with descriptions or value judgments.** 

You can use an adverb to tell what an action was like: Kevin slammed the door forcefully. But you’re better off showing the results of that action: Kevin slammed the door, shattering the wood.

Leave something to the imagination. Simplicity and austerity are powerful.

You can see why I hang with the anti-adverbs people. But adverb defenders have a point, too. Often, manner adverbs achieve the desired effect:

- Penny left quickly.
- He stared at her longingly. 
- Clean this mess up immediately.
- Senator Snide laughed cruelly
-  “I want you to leave,” Nora said simply.

Like all words, manner adverbs should be carefully chosen. They should carry some benefit that overrides the less-is-more principle. They should not create redundancies, and they should be free of that weak “look at me” quality to which they’re so prone. They should not appear to be telling the stuff that your nouns and verbs should be showing.

Only when you’ve asked yourself whether your sentence is better off without a manner adverb can you decide whether that adverb deserves to stay.





## 8. Are your relatives essential: relative clauses

Whole phrases and clauses can also be modifiers. As you’ll see in this
chapter and the two that follow, understanding phrases and clauses as modifiers is key to mastering the art of the sentence. 

With each added relative clause, we get further and further away from our main point, further down the rabbit hole of **minutiae** and minutiae about minutiae.



But Gaiman **pulled off the feat of** stacking his relative clauses. He used them to create a rhythm. That's skillful writing. Skill is bred of understanding, or at the very least of practice. So let’s take a minute to understand relative clauses and the words that make them: relative pronouns.

The relative pronouns, according to The Oxford English Grammar, are
which, that, and who or whom.

Start seeing relative clauses as something **akin to** adjectives and start
taking note of which word each relative clause points to, and you’ll have a lot more power over how you use them. And remember, relative clauses are great tools for squeezing extra information into a sentence, but only if that information fits.
Compare these two sentences: 

- The new schedule will help reduce crowds over the closing
  weekend, which is traditionally the busiest.
- The new schedule that will be implemented next year and that is
  the brainchild of Mr. Lawson, who founded the show in 1988, will
  help reduce the number of people who attend over the closing
  weekend, which is usually the biggest problem because it is
  traditionally the busiest weekend of the show that Lawson puts on.

That first example is fine. That second one needs to be broken up
because our relative clauses are cramming in too much information:

- The new schedule is the brainchild of Mr. Lawson, who founded
  the show in 1988. The schedule will help reduce the number of
  people who attend over the closing weekend, which is traditionally
  the busiest.

This revision still has relative clauses. But with just one per sentence, it now reads well. 

Now look at this sentence:
 -- He left early, which was fine by me.
Here, the relative clause that begins with which isn’t pointing to a noun. It’s pointing to a whole idea. These are sometimes called sentential relative clauses.

There are a few more things you should know about relative clauses,
which I’ll list here quickly before explaining each in full. First, relative
clauses can be either restrictive or nonrestrictive. Second, this distinction is at the center of a controversy over how you can use the word which. Third, there exists something called the zero relative, which refers to the absence of a relative pronoun at the head of a relative clause. Fourth, sometimes it’s easy to mistake a subordinating conjunction for a relative pronoun.

- Restrictive and nonrestrictive refer to the job a clause performs in a sentence.

 A restrictive clause can’t be removed from a sentence without harming the point of the main clause:

- Any house that I buy must be yellow

The relative clause here is that I buy. To test whether it’s restrictive or
nonrestrictive, take it out. You end up with:

- Any house must be yellow

Now compare that to

- The house, which has termites, is yellow.

You can lift the relative clause right out of this sentence without any
loss of meaning to the main clause. The main clause says, The house is yellow. That’s perfectly logical all by itself. The fact that it has termites is extra information. Therefore, which has termites is, in this sentence, a nonrestrictive relative clause.

And did you notice the commas? They’re a big clue. The commas tell
you that the information they set off is nonessential, often called
parenthetical information. So restrictive relative clauses do not take
commas but nonrestrictive relative clauses do. Compare these two sentences:

- The ceremony will honor the athletes, who won.
- The ceremony will honor the athletes who won

That little comma makes a world of difference. In the first sentence, all
the athletes won. In the second sentence, we see that only some athletes won and they’re the ones who will be honored. The difference **hinges on** just one comma because that comma signals whether the clause that follows is restrictive or nonrestrictive.
Most of us use relative clauses effectively every day without thinking
about them. But full mastery of the art of sentence writing requires you to stop and take notice of the stunning power of restrictive and nonrestrictive clauses.

Now that you know how to spot a relative clause, you can handle the news that relative pronouns are sometimes optional. When
you leave them out, it’s called the zero relative.

- George got the job that you wanted.
- George got the job you wanted.

Especially important is the distinction between the relative pronoun that and the subordinating conjunction that. Remember: relative clauses are modifiers (just like adjectives) but subordinate clauses can be used as subjects and objects (just like nouns). To spot the difference, just determine whether the whole that clause is modifying a noun: 

- The family that stays together. If so, it’s a relative pronoun. 

If that is followed by a whole clause it’s a subordinating conjunction:

- That you love me is all I need to know. Harry learned that life is not fair.

If you’re looking to **distill** all this stuff about relative clauses **into** a
practical guideline to help your writing, consider this: Relative clauses
seem to work best when they cast a little extra light on a thing or an idea. **But they can quickly become a problem when they’re used to insert history or backstory.** They’re at their worst when they contain an unstated “Oh, by the way” or “I never took the time to mention this before, so let me squeeze something in now.”

Consider, too, that whenever you have more than one relative clause in a sentence, you might want to break the sentence up. Then again, like Gaiman, you might not. Just know that you have the choice. 





## 9. Antique desk suitable for lady with thick legs and large drawers: Prepositional phrases 



Prepositional phrases, like relative clauses, are modifiers. But they’re
more fun because they’re so devious. It’s easy to lose track of what you’re saying with a prepositional phrase. But if you understand them for what they are—modifiers—your sentences will benefit tremendously. Let’s start with the supposedly real classified ad mentioned in our chapter title:

- Antique desk suitable for lady with thick legs and large drawers.

The ad is funny because it sounds like with thick legs and large drawers is modifying lady. It’s not. It’s modifying desk. (At least, I hope it is.)

**For lady** is a prepositional phrase. The preposition is for and its object is the noun lady. Prepositional phrases can describe or define nouns—just as adjectives do. Or they can do the work of an adverbial, answering the questions when, where, to what degree, or in what manner or modifying verbs, adjectives, other adverbs, or whole thoughts. In our advertisement, **for lady is modifying the adjective suitable just as a more straightforward adverb might: extremely suitable, undeniably suitable.**

Suitable for lady modifies desk. There’s nothing else it could be
referring to. That’s not true of our next prepositional phrase, **with thick legs and large drawers.**

See, here’s the thing about modifiers: **people usually expect them to**
**modify the closest possible word, not one that’s farther away in the sentence.** When you write, Derek had a pine armoire, a wooden bench, and a desk with thick legs and large drawers, nobody is going to wonder whether the armoire or the bench had thick legs and large drawers. They’re going to assume that this modifier is deliberately and correctly affixed to the noun closest to it. That’s the Reader’s expectation, and as writers we must be careful to accommodate it.



## 10. Dangler danger: Participles and Other Danglers 

In this chapter, we’ll look at how participial units like walking
down the beach and stuffed with chestnuts can also be modifiers. There’s just one problem: no one knows whether we should call these units phrases or clauses.

A participle is a verb form that usually ends in ing, ed, or en. The -ing
form is called the progressive participle. The -ed and -en forms are called past participles, though irregular verbs don’t follow the pattern: shown, brought, led, dealt, leapt, seen, and so on, are all past participles. Past participles work with forms of have and progressive participles work with forms of be to form different verb conjugations: We have walked, Joe is walking, and so on.

But you can also use a participle to modify a noun—just like an
adjective. 

A participial phrase or clause, then, is simply any participle that serves
as a modifier. And it can do so with or without accessories:

- Exhausted, Harry fell into bed.

  Exhausted from the long hike, Harry fell into bed.

- Speeding, Nanette hit a pole.
  Speeding in her Ferrari, Nanette hit a pole.

Either way, a participial phrase or clause can be seen as a modifier. It
modifies a noun or pronoun. So from our examples, who was exhausted? Harry. And who was speeding? Nanette. Harry and Nanette are the nouns being modified by those participial units.

Now identify what’s wrong with this sentence:

- Daydreaming about Nanette, Dan’s foot went right into a puddle.

Either Dan has one smart foot, or we have on our hands the legendary beast known as the dangling participle.

**A dangling participle is simply a participle that seems to point to the wrong noun.** As we saw in our chapter on prepositional phrases, Readers usually expect a modifier to refer to the closest noun. That’s why, in our last example, we’re suggesting that Dan’s foot was daydreaming and not Dan. To fix these, just make sure that you’ve chosen the right noun—for example, “Dan” instead of “foot”—and that the participial phrase or clause that’s modifying it is as close as possible.

- Daydreaming about Nanette, Dan stepped in a puddle.

You can also **make your participial phrase or clause into a subordinate clause so it’s no longer a modifier and therefore no longer has to be right next to whatever it’s modifying:**

- While Dan was daydreaming about Nanette, his foot went right
  into a puddle.

Participles aren’t the only things that can dangle:

- Visiting relatives can be fun.

Does this mean that the act of visiting (visiting as a gerund) can be fun, or that relatives who are visiting you (visiting as a modifier) can be fun? We don’t know. Subtler examples crop up all the time in professional writing:

- Here are the trends leading interior designers and industry experts across the country have predicted will be hot this season.

After pausing, the Reader can see that leading is an adjective modifying interior designers and not an action being performed by trends. But it’s usually best not to force the Reader to do a doubletake:

- Here are the trends that leading interior designers and industry
  experts across the country have predicted will be hot this season. 

The best way to avoid danglers is to stay vigilant. After a while it
becomes a working part of the brain. Considering how much this can help your sentences, it’s worth the effort.
