## 1. Who cares? Making sentence meaning for your readers

## 2. Conjunctions that kill: Subordination

Subordinating conjunctions are a much larger set. They include *after, although, as, because, before, if, since, than, though, unless, until, when, and while.*

A lot of common phrases serve as subordinating conjunctions as well. They include *as long as, as though, even if, even though, in order that, and whether or not.*

These subordinators all have one thing in common: They subordinate. They relegate information to less critical status. They tell the Reader, *“This is just minor info we have to get out of the way before we get to the really big news” or “We’re tacking this on as an afterthought to really big news.”*

Consider this sentence:

- Before robbing a bank, Mike was an accountant 

V.S.

- After working for twenty-five years as an accountant, Mike robbed a bank.

Subordinating conjunctions relegate clauses to a lower grammatical status. Subordination means that what was a whole sentence is whole no more. It’s a mere subordinate clause. This is why subordinate clauses are often called dependent clauses: they depend on another clause to make the sentence complete. 

Your Reader instinctively knows that a subordinate clause is less important than the main clause that’s sure to come up somewhere in your sentence. Remember that little rant about thy Reader, thy god? **That’s your guiding light here: what does your Reader most want to know?**

- The company resumed regular operations after its president failed to acquire a competing firm.

We have two actions in this sentence: a resuming of operations and a failed attempt to acquire a company. One is a big event. The other is a return to business as usual. If the failed acquisition is most notable to the reader, take that out of the subordinate clause:

- The company’s president failed to acquire a competing firm. After the deal fell through, the company resumed regular operations.

This illustrates that subordination is not a bad thing. It’s a tool. It only becomes a bad thing when you subordinate the stuff most interesting to your Reader while elevating less important information. Let’s look at another example

- Until Jane can slay the dragon, retrieve the jewel from its belly, and bribe the evil King Goombah, her mission of protecting her townsfolk will remain unfulfilled.

A sentence like this might be okay after you’ve already discussed the slaying, jewel-getting, and bribing business. But unless you’ve already fleshed out these details for your Reader, you’re throwing a wet blanket on some interesting action. Once you’re aware of the power of subordination, a whole world of options opens up to you:

- Jane must slay the dragon. Then she must cut the fabled jewel out of its belly and deliver it to the evil King Goombah. It’s the only way she can stop the massacre of her townsfolk.

Now that you’re getting the hang of this, here’s a more subtle example:

- If I’m going to give you ten million dollars, you must use it wisely.

This is not a bad sentence. *If* clauses set up conditions, which can be crucial to your meaning. But because our **if** clause contains the most interesting stuff—a ten-million-dollar gift—it’s worth considering whether we can play up that information:

- I’m going to give you ten million dollars if and only if you’ll use it wisely.

Your goal is to start to recognize subordinating conjunctions in your writing and in your reading—to see the power they afford you to serve your Reader. These words help you organize your thoughts, say what you mean, emphasize what’s most important, and even create art. If that takes a while, it’s time well spent.

## 3. Movable objects: Understanding phrases and clauses

A clause is a unit that usually contains a subject and a verb.
A phrase is a single word or a cluster of words that together work in your sentence as a single part of speech. As we have seen, phrases come in five varieties: noun phrases, verb phrases, adverb phrases, adjective phrases, and prepositional phrases

Every phrase has a headword—the word on which any other words are hinged



Has danced is a verb phrase. It contains the **auxiliary** has and the **past participle** danced. Together, they convey the action and when it occurred.

With is a **preposition**. We’ll talk more about prepositions in chapter 9.
But for now, remember that these include words like with, of, to, at, in,
above, before, and so on.  It’s crucial to note that a preposition takes an object—usually a noun phrase. Together, they’re our prepositional phrase. Note that the object of a preposition could also be a **pronoun**: with her.

verbs and prepositions are the only two parts of speech that do this. But not all verbs do. The ones that do are called **transitive**.

Who was wearing Spanx is a relative clause. It’s a modifier, which means it works like an adjective, adding extra description to the noun that comes before it: woman.

You just need to begin to identify phrases and clauses in your reading and writing. Start looking for them, especially prepositional phrases, which can be the most helpful to a writer and also the most fun, as we’ll see in chapter 9. Until then, suffice it to say that
prepositional phrases are the key to fully enjoying the supposedly real
classified advertisement that once offered for sale “mixing bowl set
designed to please cook with round bottom for efficient beating”!

Stop! is a complete clause and even a complete sentence because, in English, commands—called **imperatives**—drop the subject, which is you:

## 4. Size matters: Short versus Long Sentences

- Alec Baldwin has the unbending, straight-armed gait of someone
  trying to prevent clothes from rubbing against sunburned skin.
- Alec Baldwin, who stars in 30 Rock, the NBC sitcom that has
  revived his career and done nothing to lift his spirits, has the
  unbending, straight-armed gait of someone trying to prevent clothes from rubbing against sunburned skin.

Personally, I have a strong bias in favor of short sentences.  But the second sentence carries some unique benefits. It shakes up the Reader by defying conventional form. As such, it has an ability to command attention that the shorter version does not. Further, some of the inserted stuff actually bolsters the point of the sentence. In particular, the fact that Baldwin’s successful show has done nothing to lift his spirits is both relevant and juicy. It gives further insight into why this guy might walk around as though he’s trying not to rub a sunburn. And though we could find plenty wrong with the real New Yorker sentence, it’s actually quite skillful and effective.



Compare two more examples and you’ll see why, in general, I’m biased
toward shorter sentences:

- I killed him even though I didn’t want to because he gave me no choice.
- I killed him. I didn’t want to. He gave me no choice.

In I killed him even though I didn’t want to because he gave me no choice, the linking terms even though and because seem mealy mouthed. It’s like the writer is scrambling to explain herself, speaking from a weak, pleading position. It’s almost ironic how the facts stand stronger when they stand alone, unmitigated by the writer’s urge to overexplain: I killed him. I didn’t want to. He gave me no choice.



I believe that modern sensibilities are more attuned to short sentences. Media culture is partly responsible. Think about it. We spend countless hours listening to thirty-second TV commercials that contain six, eight, ten sentences each. But we know that most of the words are just filler. Each commercial has only one central message that boils down into one sentence: “Windex doesn’t leave streaks.” “Drive a Mustang and you’ll be popular with the ladies.” “If you really love your kids, you’ll buy Purell hand sanitizer.” The central message is supplemented with extra sentences used to hammer home the same point. As a culture, we’re becoming ever more inclined to **tune out fluff**. **Stripped-down-bare information is an anomaly that can command our attention and our respect.**

Still, anyone who tells you straight out that short sentences are superior is either overlooking or discounting some of the most respected writers of all time.
So, then, what’s the verdict? Are short sentences better or not?
Allow me to end this debate once and for all. Here’s how you should
look at it: Brevity is a tool. It’s a very powerful tool. You don’t have to use it. But you have to know how. If you’re going to use long sentences, it should be by choice, not due to bumbling ineptitude. Every long sentence can be broken up into shorter ones, and if you don’t know how—if you don’t see within your long sentences groupings of simple, clear ideas—it will show.

You should master the art of the short sentence, even if you prefer
longer ones. All you have to do is start looking at every sentence as a
group of phrases and clauses. See in each sentence how every bit of information could carry a sentence of its own. Then you’ll have the power to decide exactly how to organize your information.

Let's practice:

- Job hunters read and hear all the time that it’s not always enough
  simply to be qualified for a job because, if other qualified candidates are pursuing and competing for the same vacancy, how well you distinguish yourself from the competition is also critical to getting hired.

Now let’s separate some of the bits of information in this sentence. For this breakdown, we’re not looking for clauses but for all the individual ideas in the sentence:

- There is something that job hunters frequently hear.

- It is also something they frequently read.
- Being qualified for a job isn’t always enough to land a job.
- Other candidates may be pursuing the same vacancy.
- Other candidates may be competing for the same vacancy.
- Distinguishing yourself is critical to getting hired.

Do you see unnecessary information in here? Is it really important to
note that job hunters hear and read this? Why stop there? Why not say they hear and read and sniff out and deduce and realize and innately understand and feel with their fingertips while reading Braille and any other activity that conveys information to your brain? No doubt, the writer believed she’d be remiss if she overlooked the fact that job seekers both read and hear it. **My advice: Be remiss. It’s okay to just say, “They hear it all the time,” as long as your Reader understands. There’s no need to include a laundry list of all the ways that a job seeker might encounter the information.**

Another bit of unnecessary information in our sentence is that business about other candidates pursuing and competing for the same vacancy. Even more than the see and read stuff, this is a major duh. Pursuing the same vacancy means competing. Also, how is competing for the same job different from competing for the job? The word compete already suggests that it’s the same job. Adding the word same creates a redundancy on top of the redundancy pursuing and competing for. So, what would you do with our original Franken sentence? The possibilities are infinite. Here, slightly disguised, is what I did:

Job hunters ~~read  and~~ hear <u>it</u> all the time ~~that~~: It’s not always
enough ~~simply~~ to be qualified for a job. ~~~~because if other qualified~~
~~candidates are pursuing and competing for the same vacancy, how~~
well~~ You <u>need to</u> distinguish yourself from the competition ~~is also~~
~~critical to getting hired.~~



By the way, don’t feel bad if your sentences come out long and
rambling at first. For many people, that’s just part of the writing process. I write some major stinkers myself. It doesn’t mean you’re a bad writer or you lack talent. It just means that your process for writing good sentences involves putting your messy ideas on paper before cleaning them up. I suppose some people organize all their thoughts in their head before putting them on paper. Kudos to them. But it doesn’t mean they’re necessarily better writers. There’s nothing wrong with writing sentences that come out clunky at first, as long as you can reread your own writing and see where revisions could make your sentences better.

Let’s analyze another sentence. This one’s a little trickier than the last.
It’s based on a real but unpublished sentence by a professional writer:

- In addition to assisting her with the practical aspects of returning
  to school (such as writing a successful application essay and
  obtaining financial aid), Elizabeth, the center’s advisor, who was
  always quick with a smile and a word of encouragement, helped Rona address her feelings of self-doubt, uncertainty, and  apprehensiveness.

What to do, then, about this monstrous sentence? Often, the simplest
solution is to just drop all the conjunctions and fillers and parentheses and other connecting devices and make simple sentences out of what’s left. That is, isolate the clauses and/or distinct ideas and form them into individual sentences:

- Elizabeth assisted Rona with the practical aspects of returning to school. She helped Rona write an application essay and apply for
  financial aid. Elizabeth was the center’s advisor. She was always
  quick with a smile or a word of encouragement. She helped Rona
  address her feelings of self-doubt, uncertainty, and apprehensiveness.

Now we can see that the very essence of our bad sentence was actually a cluster of clear, simple ideas that can be expressed clearly and simply. The beauty of boiling it down this way is that now you can make more choices.

Personally, I’d go for a clear, no-frills rewrite like this:

Elizabeth, the center’s advisor, assisted Rona with the practical
aspects of returning to school (14). She helped Rona write an application essay and apply for financial aid (12). Always quick with a smile or a word of encouragement, Elizabeth also helped Rona address her feelings of self-doubt and apprehensiveness (21).

There’s no single right answer. And again, every rewrite contains the
**danger** of lost meaning or lost information or even the possibility you’ll make the sentence factually incorrect. So while reworking for clarity, the writer must always **keep a tight rein on** accuracy and meaning.

If it helps, divide writing into two categories: craft and art. If you’re
plying the craft of writing, aim to make many of your sentences short.
Note the word many. Even the most hard-nosed short-sentence advocate will agree that too many short sentences strung together can be downright droning. Mixing short sentences with long ones can make your writing more rhythmically pleasing and therefore more Reader friendly. Writers of business letters, press releases, nonfiction books, genre novels—anyone who is more interested in content than form—usually fall into this writing as-craft category in which short sentences are probably a virtue.

If, on the other hand, you’re shooting for art, all bets are off. Art and
beauty, more so than clarity and expediency, are in the eye of the **beholder**. If you think you can write an eighty-nine-word sentence that creates for your Reader a better experience than would a **ten- or fifteen-word sentence,** do. Go nuts. But remember, short sentences can be art, too. Any fan of Hemingway can tell you that. McCarthy himself is proof:

- He squatted and watched it. He could smell the smoke.
- He wet his finger and held it to the wind.

McCarthy uses plenty of short sentences, as this excerpt from The Road illustrates. He’s even into sentence fragments and uses them to great effect. His range proves my point: only someone who can see ideas in their most **pared-down** form can begin stringing them together in ways that make an outrageously long sentence work.



## 5. Words gone wild: Sentences that say nothing-or worse



Pay attention to your words. Try not to zone out or become
hypnotized by the clichés that live in all our heads and that try to slip into everyone’s writing. When you reread your writing, try to do so with a scrutinizing eye that asks, is there a better way to nail down what I really mean?



## 6. Words gone wild: Choosing specific words over vague ones

Words like structure and items and person usually have no business in
your sentences. They’re just wispy shadows of the things they’re trying to represent. Ask yourself whether there’s a more concrete word that can create a more real experience for your Reader. Sometimes, the answer will be no. But often you’ll find that there are much better alternatives to these opaque words. Whatever you do, don’t let laziness or cowardice dictate your word
choices.

Not every sentence needs to be packed with details and descriptors. But learning to pinpoint and root out vague words will give you more choices and therefore more power to construct the best sentence for your piece and for your Reader.

## 7. A frequently overstated case: The truth about adverbs

It is, perhaps, the most famous bit of sentence-writing advice of all
time: avoid adverbs. Yet I’d guess that about nine out of ten people who spout this advice would flunk the following test. Find all the adverbs in this sentence: 

- Knowing well that I can visit you there soon is not really very
  helpful, as I am not well and therefore cannot prudently travel
  tomorrow.

That’s right, there are eight—count ’em, eight—adverbs in this
sentence. They are well (the first but not the second one), there, soon,
really, very, therefore, prudently, and tomorrow. Yep, this tomorrow is an adverb. Don’t believe me? Look it up in your dictionary. I’ll wait.

When people say that adverbs hurt writing, they’re talking about a
specific kind of adverb, called a manner adverb—even though they may not realize it. Manner adverbs are the ones that describe the manner in which an action occurred: walk quickly, eat slowly, dance enthusiastically. When people say to avoid them, there’s some wisdom in their advice, but only for those wise enough to understand it.

Think of an adverbial as any unit doing an adverb’s job: answering
when, where, or in what manner, or modifying a whole thought. Adverbs can modify verbs (Mark whistles happily), adjectives (Betty is
extremely tall), other adverbs (Mark whistles extremely happily), or whole sentences (However, I don’t care).

Full mastery of adverbs takes time and, frankly, isn’t necessary for our
goal of writing good sentences. But there are three things you should
remember about adverbs:

1. Adverbs are a very broad group that includes those -ly words we
all learned, but also many other types of words. To identify
adverbs, think of them as words that answer the questions when,
where, how, to what degree, and in what manner. When in
doubt, check a dictionary. Better yet, check two or three.
2. When someone tells a writer to avoid adverbs, the speaker
really means avoid manner adverbs—the ones that answer the
questions in what manner and to what degree.
3. Adverbials can be single words or whole phrases that inject
    when-, where-, or how-type information into your sentence (I’ll
    exercise on Monday) or offer commentary on the whole
    sentence: Tragically, Jonas was fired. In consequence, he found
    a new job.

Let’s look at another example:

- People who aren’t happy in their jobs may be more likely to stay
  with their current employers than look for new ones because they see so many Americans involuntarily losing their jobs.

This sentence is from a piece by a professional columnist, which proves that even the best of us can encounter adverb problems. **Involuntarily losing their jobs, in this sentence at least, is not one iota different from just plain old losing their jobs**. The Reader gets the message and doesn’t need to be told that getting canned is involuntary.

When we eliminate the adverb, we take out a redundancy. But we also
streamline the sentence for some less-is-more value:

- because they see so many Americans losing their jobs.

**This is a sentence-level microcosm of that most iconic bit of writing advice: show, don’t tell. Job loss is a thing. The Reader can see it for what it is. He doesn’t need it gussied up with descriptions or value judgments.** 

You can use an adverb to tell what an action was like: Kevin slammed the door forcefully. But you’re better off showing the results of that action: Kevin slammed the door, shattering the wood.

Leave something to the imagination. Simplicity and austerity are powerful.

You can see why I hang with the anti-adverbs people. But adverb defenders have a point, too. Often, manner adverbs achieve the desired effect:

- Penny left quickly.
- He stared at her longingly. 
- Clean this mess up immediately.
- Senator Snide laughed cruelly
-  “I want you to leave,” Nora said simply.

Like all words, manner adverbs should be carefully chosen. They should carry some benefit that overrides the less-is-more principle. They should not create redundancies, and they should be free of that weak “look at me” quality to which they’re so prone. They should not appear to be telling the stuff that your nouns and verbs should be showing.

Only when you’ve asked yourself whether your sentence is better off without a manner adverb can you decide whether that adverb deserves to stay.





## 8. Are your relatives essential: relative clauses

Whole phrases and clauses can also be modifiers. As you’ll see in this
chapter and the two that follow, understanding phrases and clauses as modifiers is key to mastering the art of the sentence. 

With each added relative clause, we get further and further away from our main point, further down the rabbit hole of **minutiae** and minutiae about minutiae.



But Gaiman **pulled off the feat of** stacking his relative clauses. He used them to create a rhythm. That's skillful writing. Skill is bred of understanding, or at the very least of practice. So let’s take a minute to understand relative clauses and the words that make them: relative pronouns.

The relative pronouns, according to The Oxford English Grammar, are
which, that, and who or whom.

Start seeing relative clauses as something **akin to** adjectives and start
taking note of which word each relative clause points to, and you’ll have a lot more power over how you use them. And remember, relative clauses are great tools for squeezing extra information into a sentence, but only if that information fits.
Compare these two sentences: 

- The new schedule will help reduce crowds over the closing
  weekend, which is traditionally the busiest.
- The new schedule that will be implemented next year and that is
  the brainchild of Mr. Lawson, who founded the show in 1988, will
  help reduce the number of people who attend over the closing
  weekend, which is usually the biggest problem because it is
  traditionally the busiest weekend of the show that Lawson puts on.

That first example is fine. That second one needs to be broken up
because our relative clauses are cramming in too much information:

- The new schedule is the brainchild of Mr. Lawson, who founded
  the show in 1988. The schedule will help reduce the number of
  people who attend over the closing weekend, which is traditionally
  the busiest.

This revision still has relative clauses. But with just one per sentence, it now reads well. 

Now look at this sentence:
 -- He left early, which was fine by me.
Here, the relative clause that begins with which isn’t pointing to a noun. It’s pointing to a whole idea. These are sometimes called sentential relative clauses.

There are a few more things you should know about relative clauses,
which I’ll list here quickly before explaining each in full. First, relative
clauses can be either restrictive or nonrestrictive. Second, this distinction is at the center of a controversy over how you can use the word which. Third, there exists something called the zero relative, which refers to the absence of a relative pronoun at the head of a relative clause. Fourth, sometimes it’s easy to mistake a subordinating conjunction for a relative pronoun.

- Restrictive and nonrestrictive refer to the job a clause performs in a sentence.

 A restrictive clause can’t be removed from a sentence without harming the point of the main clause:

- Any house that I buy must be yellow

The relative clause here is that I buy. To test whether it’s restrictive or
nonrestrictive, take it out. You end up with:

- Any house must be yellow

Now compare that to

- The house, which has termites, is yellow.

You can lift the relative clause right out of this sentence without any
loss of meaning to the main clause. The main clause says, The house is yellow. That’s perfectly logical all by itself. The fact that it has termites is extra information. Therefore, which has termites is, in this sentence, a nonrestrictive relative clause.

And did you notice the commas? They’re a big clue. The commas tell
you that the information they set off is nonessential, often called
parenthetical information. So restrictive relative clauses do not take
commas but nonrestrictive relative clauses do. Compare these two sentences:

- The ceremony will honor the athletes, who won.
- The ceremony will honor the athletes who won

That little comma makes a world of difference. In the first sentence, all
the athletes won. In the second sentence, we see that only some athletes won and they’re the ones who will be honored. The difference **hinges on** just one comma because that comma signals whether the clause that follows is restrictive or nonrestrictive.
Most of us use relative clauses effectively every day without thinking
about them. But full mastery of the art of sentence writing requires you to stop and take notice of the stunning power of restrictive and nonrestrictive clauses.

Now that you know how to spot a relative clause, you can handle the news that relative pronouns are sometimes optional. When
you leave them out, it’s called the zero relative.

- George got the job that you wanted.
- George got the job you wanted.

Especially important is the distinction between the relative pronoun that and the subordinating conjunction that. Remember: relative clauses are modifiers (just like adjectives) but subordinate clauses can be used as subjects and objects (just like nouns). To spot the difference, just determine whether the whole that clause is modifying a noun: 

- The family that stays together. If so, it’s a relative pronoun. 

If that is followed by a whole clause it’s a subordinating conjunction:

- That you love me is all I need to know. Harry learned that life is not fair.

If you’re looking to **distill** all this stuff about relative clauses **into** a
practical guideline to help your writing, consider this: Relative clauses
seem to work best when they cast a little extra light on a thing or an idea. **But they can quickly become a problem when they’re used to insert history or backstory.** They’re at their worst when they contain an unstated “Oh, by the way” or “I never took the time to mention this before, so let me squeeze something in now.”

Consider, too, that whenever you have more than one relative clause in a sentence, you might want to break the sentence up. Then again, like Gaiman, you might not. Just know that you have the choice. 





## 9. Antique desk suitable for lady with thick legs and large drawers: Prepositional phrases 



Prepositional phrases, like relative clauses, are modifiers. But they’re
more fun because they’re so devious. It’s easy to lose track of what you’re saying with a prepositional phrase. But if you understand them for what they are—modifiers—your sentences will benefit tremendously. Let’s start with the supposedly real classified ad mentioned in our chapter title:

- Antique desk suitable for lady with thick legs and large drawers.

The ad is funny because it sounds like with thick legs and large drawers is modifying lady. It’s not. It’s modifying desk. (At least, I hope it is.)

**For lady** is a prepositional phrase. The preposition is for and its object is the noun lady. Prepositional phrases can describe or define nouns—just as adjectives do. Or they can do the work of an adverbial, answering the questions when, where, to what degree, or in what manner or modifying verbs, adjectives, other adverbs, or whole thoughts. In our advertisement, **for lady is modifying the adjective suitable just as a more straightforward adverb might: extremely suitable, undeniably suitable.**

Suitable for lady modifies desk. There’s nothing else it could be
referring to. That’s not true of our next prepositional phrase, **with thick legs and large drawers.**

See, here’s the thing about modifiers: **people usually expect them to**
**modify the closest possible word, not one that’s farther away in the sentence.** When you write, Derek had a pine armoire, a wooden bench, and a desk with thick legs and large drawers, nobody is going to wonder whether the armoire or the bench had thick legs and large drawers. They’re going to assume that this modifier is deliberately and correctly affixed to the noun closest to it. That’s the Reader’s expectation, and as writers we must be careful to accommodate it.



## 10. Dangler danger: Participles and Other Danglers 

In this chapter, we’ll look at how participial units like walking
down the beach and stuffed with chestnuts can also be modifiers. There’s just one problem: no one knows whether we should call these units phrases or clauses.

A participle is a verb form that usually ends in ing, ed, or en. The -ing
form is called the progressive participle. The -ed and -en forms are called past participles, though irregular verbs don’t follow the pattern: shown, brought, led, dealt, leapt, seen, and so on, are all past participles. Past participles work with forms of have and progressive participles work with forms of be to form different verb conjugations: We have walked, Joe is walking, and so on.

But you can also use a participle to modify a noun—just like an
adjective. 

A participial phrase or clause, then, is simply any participle that serves
as a modifier. And it can do so with or without accessories:

- Exhausted, Harry fell into bed.

  Exhausted from the long hike, Harry fell into bed.

- Speeding, Nanette hit a pole.
  Speeding in her Ferrari, Nanette hit a pole.

Either way, a participial phrase or clause can be seen as a modifier. It
modifies a noun or pronoun. So from our examples, who was exhausted? Harry. And who was speeding? Nanette. Harry and Nanette are the nouns being modified by those participial units.

Now identify what’s wrong with this sentence:

- Daydreaming about Nanette, Dan’s foot went right into a puddle.

Either Dan has one smart foot, or we have on our hands the legendary beast known as the dangling participle.

**A dangling participle is simply a participle that seems to point to the wrong noun.** As we saw in our chapter on prepositional phrases, Readers usually expect a modifier to refer to the closest noun. That’s why, in our last example, we’re suggesting that Dan’s foot was daydreaming and not Dan. To fix these, just make sure that you’ve chosen the right noun—for example, “Dan” instead of “foot”—and that the participial phrase or clause that’s modifying it is as close as possible.

- Daydreaming about Nanette, Dan stepped in a puddle.

You can also **make your participial phrase or clause into a subordinate clause so it’s no longer a modifier and therefore no longer has to be right next to whatever it’s modifying:**

- While Dan was daydreaming about Nanette, his foot went right
  into a puddle.

Participles aren’t the only things that can dangle:

- Visiting relatives can be fun.

Does this mean that the act of visiting (visiting as a gerund) can be fun, or that relatives who are visiting you (visiting as a modifier) can be fun? We don’t know. Subtler examples crop up all the time in professional writing:

- Here are the trends leading interior designers and industry experts across the country have predicted will be hot this season.

After pausing, the Reader can see that leading is an adjective modifying interior designers and not an action being performed by trends. But it’s usually best not to force the Reader to do a doubletake:

- Here are the trends that leading interior designers and industry
  experts across the country have predicted will be hot this season. 

The best way to avoid danglers is to stay vigilant. After a while it
becomes a working part of the brain. Considering how much this can help your sentences, it’s worth the effort.

## 11. The writing was ignored by the reader: Passives 

There are two myths about passives that we need to debunk right away:
1. Passive structure is bad.
2. Passive structure is any action-impaired sentence that uses an
-ing or -ed verb with a form of to be (like is or was).

Caveats about passives have been overstated and distorted. Yes,
passives can be awful. Yes, they’re a serious problem for some novice
writers. Yes, you need to be on the lookout for them. But this doesn’t
mean passives are always bad. They’re quite useful when used wisely—indispensable, even. So here’s how you should look at them. It will
probably sound familiar: passive voice is a powerful tool in the hands of a skilled writer, but it’s **brain-numbing poison** in the hands of an unskilled writer. So you should understand the concept and use the passive only by choice. Learn to recognize passive sentences so you can consider whether they would be better in the active voice.

Luckily, the concept is easy to master.
Here’s the best way to understand passive voice: it occurs when the
object of an action is made the grammatical subject of a sentence.
(Technically, it’s more precise to say that the passive occurs when the
object of a transitive verb is made the subject of a sentence. But if that
makes your eyes glaze over, stick with the first definition.) Compare these two sentences:

- Ned made the coffee.
  The coffee was made by Ned.

In the first example, we have someone performing an action, followed
by the action itself, followed by the thing being acted upon: subject + verb object. In the second example, the thing being acted upon, the object, is made the subject of our sentence. That’s passive structure. 

Anytime you want to downplay the doer of an action, use the passives. Passives come pretty naturally, even to people who have no idea what a participle is. So don’t worry about the mechanics. Just start recognizing passive sentences and considering whether they would be better in active form. The answer can be subjective. **But the passives that writing pros consider bad are the ones that squelch interesting action.**

- Tim was shot by Barbara is anemic compared to 
- Barbara shot Tim. 

The latter has a sense of immediacy and power. Passive forms dilute that power. In our active form, the action is the verb. In passive form, the verb emphasizes being more than doing. That’s what people mean when they say that passives are bad. Yes, their point is overstated, but there’s a big lump of truth at its center. Passives often stink:

- After he had been flown to Chicago and had been checked into his
  hotel room, he was called on the phone by his boss.

Sometimes, the best way to fix bad passives is to restructure the
passage:

- His company flew him to Chicago. After he arrived and checked
  into his hotel room, his boss called.

## 12. You will have been conjugating: Others matters of Tense 



Most straight news stories are written in the simple past tense. The
reason: They tell of things that happened.

Fiction, too, is often written in the past tense. Novelists and short story
writers sometimes choose the present tense, usually for the reason that present tense carries an **in-the-moment urgency** not found in past tenses, so it’s a valid creative device.

I can’t tell you which tense to choose for your writing. No one can. But
there’s much to be learned by professional writers’ choices. Simple past tense is the standard form. It’s a safe choice. You can deviate from it, but unless you have a good reason to, maybe you shouldn’t.

So far, we’ve been looking at straightforward tenses: simple past,
present progressive, and simple present. But what about more complex tenses?

- Tommy Q. Public was applying to law school. [past progressive]

- Jane Doe had been making breakfast when she heard the crash.
  [past perfect progressive]

Obviously, these tenses can be indispensable and have a place in both
fiction and nonfiction. In fiction, especially, if a writer can pull it off, she’s free to load up her stories with stuff like:

- Pilly Bilgrim will have been becoming unstuck in time. [future
  perfect progressive]

But even writers who want to avoid these tenses should understand how they function.
As explained in The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Grammar and Style, the
past perfect is used for an “action completed before another.”

 The past perfect progressive is used for a “continuing action interrupted by another.” 

The future perfect progressive is for a “continuing future action
done before another.”

Notice how these all mention “another”? These complex verb tenses tell when one action took place relative to when another took place:

- After having been rejected by NASA and Caltech, Lucky got a
  job at McDonald’s.

The verb tenses tell us that Lucky got the McDonald’s job after the
other two places shot him down. But they tell us something more. **We**
**know that Lucky got a job is the big event in this sentence. After having been rejected is something that happened relative to that big moment.** So verb tenses, like subordination, tell the Reader what information is most important. **Amy had been going to the same beauty parlor for twenty years** begs to be followed by **when, as in when her hair fell out**. 

All the verb tenses and even the passive voice are tools you can use
anytime that they work. But simple past tense and active voice are safe choices that can save you anytime you get into trouble



## 13. The being and the doing are the killing of your writing

Nominalization is a simple concept, and taking a few moments to
master it could help your writing tremendously. Consider this sentence:

- The walking of the dog was the difficulty from which Sherry’s
  laziness had its emergence.

In this sentence, walking, difficulty, laziness, and emergence all work as nouns. But walking and emergence are rooted in verbs: to walk and to emerge. Laziness and difficulty are rooted in adjectives: lazy and difficult. 

These are often called nominalizations. **A nominalization is a form of a verb or an adjective that functions as a noun.** Some call them buried verbs. Still others say that the ones that end in ing—called gerunds—don’t qualify as nominalizations. But they can all hurt your writing in the same way, so we’ll look at them all together. Here are some examples of the dreaded beasts called nominalizations:



- utilization (from the verb utilize)
- happiness (from the adjective happy)
- movement (from the verb move)

- lying (from the verb lie) 
- persecution (from the verb persecute)
- dismissal (from the verb dismiss)
- fabrication (from the verb fabricate)
- atonement (from the verb atone)
- creation (from the verb create)
- intensity(from the adjective intense)
- cultivation (from the verb cultivate)
- refusal (from the verb refuse)
- incarceration (from the verb incarcerate)

Obviously, these are all legitimate words. They become a problem only
when a writer uses them in place of more interesting actions or
descriptions. Nine times out of ten, Barb was happy is better than Barb had happiness or Barb exhibited happiness.
Nominalizations are worst when an unskilled writer puts them into the
form the + gerund + of. As we just saw, a gerund is the form of a verb that ends in ing and is used as a noun. Outside of a sentence, gerunds are indistinguishable from participles.

- Singing is hard [singing as a subject = gerund]
- She was singing [singing as part of verb phrase = participle]

Combined with a the and of, gerunds can be really bad news:

- The singing of the song 
- The considering of the job offer 
- The walking of the dog 
- The knowing of the facts 
- The remembering of the appointment

Gerunds aren’t the only nominalized forms that work with the and of
this way. Nominalizations rooted in adjectives can, too.

- The happiness of the bride 
- The intensity of the staring
-  The blatantness of the flirting

While these are better than the gerund examples earlier, they’re still
pretty bad. When you fix a nominalization, you turn the real action into the main verb and you get to bring in the person or thing doing the action.

- The happiness of the bride was evident.
  = The bride was happy. That was evident.

- The refusal of the gift was shocking.
  = Vanessa refused the gift. I was shocked.
- Bob’s acquittal by the jury took place Monday.
  = On Monday the jury acquitted Bob.
- I appreciate Trevor’s support.
  = Trevor supports me and I appreciate it.

Notice how, **in that last example, the nominalized form might be preferable.** That goes to show you that a nominalization can be an
excellent choice. But it can also be a terrible choice. So keep an eye out for nominalizations. Think of each as an opportunity—a chance to consider alternative, possibly better ways to structure your sentence. Sometimes you’ll find that **recasting them in simple subject-plus-verb form can make a better experience for the Reader.** Sometimes you’ll want to leave them as they are.

**But don’t write off all nominalizations as bad.** Without them, this whole chapter couldn’t have existed, because nominalization is itself a
nominalization



##  14. The The : Not-so-definite definite articles 

Ever stop to think about the word the? It’s a tiny word, yet it’s huge. It
carries so much responsibility. It leans so heavily on your Reader. It says, “You’re expected to know what I’m talking about.” I guess that’s why it’s so annoying when a writer hasn’t **done her due diligence** before **dumping this expectation on you**.

If you’ve been concocting a story involving a diary, that diary is very familiar to you. You know it intimately in a way that only a creator can. You know what condition the cover is in. You know whether it has a lock. You know what words are written inside and whether those
words have the power to hurt or even to kill. To you, it’s no longer just a diary. It’s the diary—**the one you’ve pictured and pondered and imbued with life-changing importance**. When you finally start to put this thing you created into words, you have to **step outside your head** far enough to remember that the Reader hasn’t spent the last year or two **getting cozy with the diary.** It’s the writer’s job to put it in the Reader’s hands—to bridge the gap between a state of unknowing and a state of knowing. That’s what writing is.

I realize this is a lot of rumination about one little word, but this stuff is
worth thinking about. For one thing, the cuts straight to the heart of
Reader-serving writing. A badly used the happens because the writer got too wrapped up in what she was trying to say and forgot to be sensitive to the person she was saying it to.

So, now that I’ve thoroughly slammed using the to refer to stuff
heretofore unknown to the Reader, how can we explain an all-too-common use of the like the one found in the very first sentence of the novel Travels in the Scriptorium, by Paul Auster?

- The old man sits on the edge of the narrow bed, palms spread out
  on his knees, head down, staring at the floor.

This is the first sentence of the whole novel. The the suggests that we’ve already been introduced to the character and his surroundings, even though we have not. Yet it simply does not have the power to irk the Reader the way our diary did. What’s up with that?

Simple. It’s the **flip side of the same coin.** If the suggests familiarity,
then putting the in front of something so surely unfamiliar suggests that familiarity will come. It foreshadows. It teases. The Reader knows that the writer is going to explain who the old man is. The writer is asking for the Reader’s trust and promising something in return. It’s a great device that skillful writers use all the time. It demonstrates the power of the. And **it illustrates the importance of staying attuned to your Reader.**

## 15. The writer and his father lamented his ineptitude 

In the title of this chapter, “The Writer and His Father Lamented His
Ineptitude,” it’s clear that someone is inept. The problem is we don’t know who. His could refer to the writer or to his father. In the context of this book, **it’s a safe bet** that we would be more focused on the writer. So we can guess that Sonny Boy is the one being slammed in this sentence. But the grammar doesn’t confirm this. So we can’t be sure. **The possibility remains** it could be Dad whose shortcomings are being lamented.

This problem is called an unclear antecedent. At its worst, this problem can completely ruin a written work:

- As the sheriff and the bandit fired their guns, a bullet pierced his heart. He fell to the ground. He was dead。

From the first sentence, we can’t know whether it was the good guy or
the bad guy who died. From the sentences that follow, it’s clear that it will take a while for us to find out. Maybe we never will. The **passage is confusing and annoying** and can be enough to make a Reader close a book or put down a manuscript forever.

Happily, these problems are easy to avoid. First, remember the lessons of our chapter on the. The Reader isn‘t in your head. Second, remember to pay careful attention to your pronouns梕specially on the reread. This includes

- subject pronouns: I, you, he, she, it, we, they
- object pronouns: me, you, him, her, it, us, them
- possessive pronouns: mine, yours, his, hers, its, ours, theirs
- possessive determiners (think of these as adjective forms of
- possessive pronouns): my, your, his, her, its, our, their 
- relative pronouns: that, which, who, whom

Make it a habit to **scrutinize** every him, her, and so on, to be sure they’re clear. When they’re not, they’re easy to fix:

- As the sheriff and the bandit fired their guns, a bullet **pierced the bandit’s heart.** He fell to the ground. He was dead.

Notice that we left he in the last two sentences. It’s clear that he is the
bandit. The Reader gets that. Of course, we can imagine scenarios in which that he might not be so clear. If the bandit got shot just two sentences after the sheriff got shot, then it may not be clear at all to your Reader which one fell to the ground. But again, see how the Reader is your guiding light? It’s almost as though he is helping you. **Call it paradox, call it karma, call it a variation on AA members’ belief that helping others helps them stay sober.** Whatever. Just remember its power.



Not all pronouns are as easy to work with as personal pronouns like he and him. Take it. Unlike pronouns that refer to specific people, the pronoun it can refer to vague things like ideas. Compare these two uses of it:

- The car is parked. It is in a handicapped space.
- Jenna knows math. It is why she landed this job.

It is a pronoun like any other. It stands in for a noun. In the first
example, the antecedent of it is clearly the car. But in our second example, what noun, exactly, does it represent? Jenna? Nope. Math? Nope. That leaves just knows, but that’s a conjugated verb—an action under way. How can a pronoun refer to a verb? Easy: if, in the writer’s head, it stands in for knowing, then that’s what it means. The antecedent is implied. It could be the gerund knowing, as in, Knowing math is why Jenna landed this job. It could be an implied noun like The fact that Jenna knows math is why she landed the job or Jenna’s knowledge of math is why she landed the job. 

**That and which are two other pronouns that create problems**:

- I went to the movies with my daughter, and though we were late, we caught most of the new Woody Allen movie. That’s what life is all about.

What is what life is all about? Spending time with your daughter? Being late? Grabbing what you can out of a bad situation? Woody Allen? The slice of life created by combining all these elements? The writer should be clearer:

- I went to the movies with my daughter, and though we were late, we caught most of the new Woody Allen movie. ~~--That’s--~~Afternoons like that are what life is all about.
- I went to the movies with my daughter, and though we were late, we caught most of the new Woody Allen movie. ~~That’s~~ Grabbing what you can is what life is all about.

This lesson extends beyond pronouns:

- Health care and education are among the fields that have added jobs. The audiovisual industry is, too.

This isn’t wrong per se, but it causes me to do a double take. The
audiovisual industry is what? It takes a moment to realize that the writer omitted part of the second sentence. When I look at the example about health care and education, what's most interesting to me is how the writer set herself up for trouble. **Had she aimed for something less wordy than that whole are among the structure, the sentence would have been clear**：

- The ~~H~~health care and education ~~are among the~~ fields ~~that~~ have added jobs. The audiovisual industry ~~is~~ has, too.

## 16. To know them is to hating them: Faulty and funky parallels 

Parallel form relies on Reader expectations. When Readers see something in list form, they expect it to be a list:

- Pablo has visited Maine, Idaho, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and New Jersey.

When you include an element that doesn’t work like the others, you
betray those expectations:

- Pablo has visited Maine, Idaho, Pennsylvania, loves Georgia, and New Jersey.

 Parallels can be lists of words, phrases, or whole clauses. Each element should be in the same form and should attach in the same way to any shared phrase or clause. Look at this example:

- This car runs fast, lasts long, requires little maintenance, and holds its value.

The shared element is this car. Each of the listed items is a verb phrase that, on its own, can make this car a complete sentence. They all attach to this car in the same way. That would not work if one of the items was not a verb phrase, like “well” in this example:

- This car runs fast, well, lasts long, requires little maintenance, and holds its value.

lasts long, runs requires little maintenance, and runs holds its value. But that’s not what we meant at all.
There are several ways to fix faulty parallels. You can add bits to the parallel items until they’re equals:

- This car runs fast, runs well, lasts long, requires little maintenance, and holds its value.

Or you can break up the sentence in a way that signals that the list has ended:

- This car runs fast, well, and long, and it requires little maintenance and holds its value. 

Parallels don’t have to be faulty to be jarring:

- I was entertained by the decor, as well as the live piano music.

You could argue that *entertained by* applies to both the listed items. But it would be clearer if you repeated the **by**.

- I was entertained **by** the decor, as well as **by** the live piano music.

Every parallel poses its own unique dangers. There’s no simple formula for getting it right every time. All you can do is proceed with caution and remember the Reader.

## 17. Taking the punk out of punctuation: The problem with semicolons and parentheses 

discussion of semicolons and parentheses, keep looking. You’ll find no balance here. I hate semicolons. I hate them so much that, even though I admit that they can be useful—lifesavers even—I’m comfortable saying that I hate them. I hate parentheses almost as much. They, too, have their place. In fact, I use them. As a Reader, I sometimes enjoy the effect they can create. Yet these reasonable observations don’t mean I’m reasonable on the subject. I’ve seen too many writers abuse these punctuation marks too many times. I can’t let go. I won’t.

We’ll start with an open airing of my biases:
1. Semicolons often serve no purpose other than to show off that the writer knows how to use semicolons.
2. Parentheses often let a writer cram in information she was too lazy to explain in a more Reader-friendly manner.
Aah. Feels good to get that off my chest. Now we can take a more academic approach.

Other, more reasonable experts also dislike semicolons: “The semicolon is an ugly bastard, and thus I tend to avoid it,” writes Washington Post business copy desk chief Bill Walsh in the book Lapsing Into a Comma.
That brings us to another important point: **Readability and aesthetics go hand in hand**. A sentence riddled with semicolons can be hard on the eyes—Readers’ eyes.

“My advice to writers just starting out? Don’t use semicolons!” Kurt Vonnegut said in a 2007 speech. “They are transvestite hermaphrodites, representing exactly nothing. All they do is suggest you might have gone to college.”



Parentheses, on the other hand, can be indispensable. But often they can make a sentence messy and overly busy.

Sometimes, parentheses really are the best way to serve the information to the Reader. Usually, the smaller the parenthetical insertion, the better it works. The more stuff crammed between the parentheses and the more parentheses crammed into the sentence, the bigger the clue that the sentence needs an overhaul.

**If you disagree, you’re in good company.** Some writers love parentheses and use them **to the delight of** their Readers. David Foster Wallace was king of the **envelope-pushing parentheses**.

This goes to show you how stupid prejudices are. Wallace was a prizewinning and critically acclaimed writer. So clearly, my small-minded view of parentheses doesn’t apply. Still … how it burns in me.

Wallace used parentheses to create a maze of ideas—a place where Readers can **meander** and explore. His parentheticals were devices used for the benefit of the Reader and not for the convenience of the writer.
Many loved them. Me, I can appreciate what Wallace was doing, but I’m not a fan of these parentheticals and footnotes. I like my information served linear—one bite at a time. 



## 18. You don't say: Descriptive quotation attributions 

In journalism circles, *said* is a virtue—simple, precise, and unadorned—and alternatives to it are considered frilly and silly. You don’t have to agree, but be aware that lots of editors hold this view. Choose your
alternatives to said with great care.

Here’s another problem that crops up a lot in descriptive quotation attributions:

- “Our redesigned casino will be better than ever,” general manager and CEO Michael Roberts said, suggesting visitors try out the new higher-paying slot machines and the redesigned poker room while visiting the property and adding that the restaurant is now open 24 hours as well.

This goes back to our lesson on participles as modifiers. *Adding, suggesting, noting, implying, referring to*, and similar terms can all modify said, but some writers depend too much on this device. A quotation attribution is not an ideal place to squeeze in tons of extra information. When the result feels artificial, just make a new sentence or two.

- “Our redesigned casino will be better than ever,” general manager and CEO Michael Roberts said,. ~~suggesting~~ He suggested visitors try out the new higher-paying slot machines and the redesigned poker room. ~~while visiting the property and adding~~ He added that the restaurant is now open 24 hours as well.

If you like to get creative with quotation attributions, do. But do so because it works, not because you want to show off or be different. When in doubt, remember that said is an old friend you can always fall back on.

## 19. Trimming the fat: Expressions that weight down your sentences 

Learn to root out flabby writing and to streamline sentences to make every word count.

There’s a difference between fatty sentences and long sentences. Yes, they’re often one and the same. But not always. A 134-word sentence can be tight and economical, while an 8-word sentence can contain 7 words of lard—or even 8.

Keeping the blubber out of your sentences is no easy feat. Fatty prose sneaks into writing in many ways. It can take the form of an unnecessary  adverb, a ridiculous redundancy, a self-conscious over-explaining, a
cliché, or jargon. You should develop the habit of always considering whether your sentence would be better if you chopped out or swapped out a word, phrase, or clause. Develop the habit of considering whether each sentence is itself an asset or a liability.

In this chapter, we’ll look at the fatty sentence problems that are easiest to fix—the unnecessary words and **verbose little insertions that so often plague writers**. We’ll also look at the scary-sounding but really quite simple concepts of run-on sentences and comma splices. We’ll save the deeper structural problems for the next chapter.

Adjectives can contribute to fatty prose. Considering how indispensable they are, that’s surprising. Yet, often, they’re dead weight

Take, for example, this much-maligned first sentence of The Da Vinci Code:

- Renowned curator Jacques Saunière staggered through the vaulted archway of the museum’s Grand Gallery

Perhaps the best way to fix our Da Vinci Code sentence is to get rid of the adjective renowned altogether—maybe even get rid of the modifying noun curator and the adjective vaulted—a**nd wait for a better opportunity to convey the information.** No doubt, that’s what some more critically acclaimed writers would have done:

- Jacques Saunière staggered through the archway of the museum’s
  Grand Gallery.

Adjectives aren’t bad. They can be wonderful, and as predicates they can work perfectly: Frau Helga was tall.

But adjectives are **no substitute for solid information**. Often they have that less-is-more thing working against them: *The big, terrifying, homicidal, totally out-of-control escaped convict ran toward me* does not
achieve its desired effect. Better to just say, *The escaped convict ran toward me* and leave it at that.

If it helps, divide adjectives into two categories: facts and value judgments. **Adjectives that express fact can be fine. But adjectives that impose value judgments on your Reader are trouble.** *Bloodied and limping curator Jacques Saunière,* though awkward, is still better than *Awesome and brilliant curator Jacques Saunière.*

Worse, sometimes adjectives are meaningless. The exact same means the same. The only difference is that in the exact same, it’s clear the writer is trying to **pound home her point.** As we know, this can backfire,
weakening the point.

If all this talk about adjectives reminds you of our adverbs chapter, there’s a good reason for that. Adjectives and adverbs carry the same risks. Here’s an example:

- The freshly rejuvenated $70-million Sands Resort & Spa hearkens to Vegas’s glory days

Unless you’re actively trying to root out wasteful words, you might not notice that the word freshly modifying rejuvenated is about as meaningful as freshly refreshed. Pure redundancy. Look at the sentence without the goldbricking adverb:

- The rejuvenated $70-million Sands Resort & Spa hearkens to Vegas’s glory days.

The freshly had a **brain-numbing** effect, as if the writer used it just to meet a word count minimum. The streamlined version, though just one word shorter, emphasizes substance. It has more power to command the Reader’s attention.

As we saw in chapter 7, manner adverbs can backfire, making an idea seem weak even as it struggles to make it strong. But adverbs can also create redundancies: already existing, previously done, first begin,
currently working.

Of course, adverbs need not be redundant to be flabby:

- Sarah quickly grabbed a knife.
- Sarah grabbed a knife.

Does quickly really add anything to the sentence? **Or does the less-is-more principle render the second sentence better?** Some may disagree, and there may be times when quickly adds a crucial bit of information. But to me this sentence better conveys immediacy without the word quickly.

Watch out for manner adverbs that **add no solid information:** *extremely, very, really, incredibly, unbelievably, astonishingly, totally, truly, currently, presently, formerly, previously.*

Also watch out for ones that try too hard to add impact to actions: *cruelly, happily, wantonly, angrily, sexily, alluringly, menacingly, blissfully.* All these words have their place. They appear in the best writing, but
more often they’re found in the worst writing. So consider them red flags and weigh their use carefully.

Adverbs and adjectives aren’t the only flabby accessories that show up in writing. Here’s an example modeled after a real sentence I came across in my copyediting work:

- *In addition to* on-the-clock volunteer opportunities, ABC Co. *also* offers standard healthcare benefits, adoption assistance and flexible scheduling to help employees cultivate work/life balance.

Not every in addition to is bad. Sometimes it’s a valid choice. But usually, in addition to refers to something that’s already been discussed at length. In our sample sentence, it’s clear that the reader already knows
something about the on-the-clock volunteer opportunities being discussed.
**Chances are that the writer just finished discussing them and was looking for a segue to the next topic. In other words, she was saying, “In addition to the stuff I just told you about, here’s another thing.**” You can achieve the same effect by saying, **Here’s another thing. Or better yet, just get to the other thing.**

This brings us to another problem with our original sentence: The *in addition to* phrase introduces a clause that contains the word *also*. This is a redundancy. **It renders the entire *in addition* to phrase a complete waste.** The writer should have simply said,

- ABC Co. also offers standard healthcare benefits, adoption assistance and flexible scheduling to help employees cultivate work/life balance.

We could also ask, Do we need to say to help employees cultivate work/life balance? The answer is more subjective, but it’s worth considering whether we should chop it out.

Other flabby figures of speech to watch out for include *in terms of, for his part, he is a man who, the exact same, taking into account, as if this weren’t enough, considering all that*—the list goes on.

*He is a man who* and other terms with this structure are especially troubling: It is a place that, dancing is an activity that, *John’s is a house that, cooking is a thing that.* They all follow the form: 

noun/pronoun + to be + noun/pronoun that refers to the same thing as first + relative pronoun

**This structure shifts the focus away from the important stuff by dedicating the main clause to ridiculously obvious information:**

- He is a man who works very hard.
- Paris is a place that gets snow.
- Dancing is an activity that amounts to good exercise.
- John’s (house) is a house that was built in the 1800s.

In all these sentences, **the new information is trapped in the relative clause—those clauses that begin with that, which, who, or whom and that** we learned about in chapter 8. **The main clause is devoid of new information. It has the same problem as the upside-down subordination** we covered in chapter 2 because the **most interesting information isn’t getting top billing in the sentence**.
To fix a sentence with this structure, just **make the new information your main clause:**

- He works very hard.
- Paris gets snow
- Dancing is good exercise.
- John’s house was built in the 1800s

Keep your eyes peeled for this construction and be prepared to correct it.
Here’s another term that is often a waste of ink: *for his part.* You’d think it would be rare. But I’ve seen it quite a few times in my copyediting work. This is a slight alteration of a real sentence I copyedited:

- For Brady’s part, as the director of the Center for Computer Security at the Information Institute at the university, emphasis is on training students for the programming path.

This sentence has a number of problems, but none so glaring or so easily fixed as for Brady’s part. For Brady says the same thing with fewer words. In fact, **I can’t think of a situation in which for so-and-so’s part is better than just for so-and-so.**

And here’s an oddball little construction that crops up a lot in feature writing: **from... to**.  There’s nothing wrong with from … to constructions, so it astounds me that they’re so often the culprit in bad sentences. Here are some examples I’ve run across in my copyediting work:

- Everything from what software will be needed to how someone will book a trip and pay needs to be developed for the business.
- From donating a few hours weekly to nearby hospitals to participating in breast or ovarian cancer walks to raise research funds, millions of us donate our time and skills to myriad organizations and causes.

And here’s one with a **double whammy of** *in addition to and from … to*:

In addition to being the epicenter of bridal up-dos for those getting married on the expansive lawns, the Alex Remo Salon also caters to stressed-out guests with a comprehensive menu of facials, which range from the Moisturizing Hydration Facial, which utilizes protein, essential oils and active serums to relieve dry and sensitive skin; to the Star Facial, a 75-minute microdermabrasion session that reduces the appearance of scars, fine lines and wrinkles.

A from … to construction can set up a very long introductory phrase. The main clause has to wait until the from … to observation is complete, which can take a while.

No matter how long, a from ...to ... construction usually works as a modifier. **It’s not hard to understand why an eight-, ten-, or twenty-word modifier can be cumbersome.**

My best advice here is don’t rely on this construction too much and be prepared to abandon it if it starts to get unwieldy. If your from or your to contains its own from or to, you’re probably making a mess, as we saw
previously in to participating in breast or ovarian cancer walks to raise research funds. If it requires semicolons to hold it all together, maybe you should recast the sentence.
Also, remember that there’s no comma between the from and the to: From soup to nuts.

That’s easy to see in short from … to phrases. But longer ones get confusing, inviting errant commas:

- From soup made with the finest ingredients from age-old recipes,
  to chocolate-covered nuts we hand dip, to the moment when you get
  the check, you’ll love our service.

The first two commas shouldn’t be there. Remember: from... to......is comma free even when your blanks are so long that they make you forget you were using this construction in the first place. Of course, that’s probably a sign that your from … to setup isn’t cutting it.

Fatty prose can also happen because a writer is reluctant to make a bold statement:

- Hawaiians have adopted a lifestyle that is decidedly more leisurely and tolerant than that of their fellows on the mainland.

This problem crops up a lot in my own writing. But editing others’ writing is helping. I’m learning that it’s worth the effort to look for bold alternatives:

- The Hawaiian lifestyle is leisurely and tolerant.

Open up a copy of the New York Times or the Washington Post and you’ll see lots of sentences like the latter example but almost none like the former. That’s because top publications hate mealymouthed allusions and love solid, information-packed statements. I try to remember that.

Another example of fatty prose, again based on a real sentence by a professional writer:

- One of the more remarkable aspects of the park is the fact that it has eight manicured gardens.

Compare that to the alternative:

- The park has eight manicured gardens.

These six words do a better job of conveying the information than do the eighteen words in the first sentence. You get extra points if you noticed that, in the first example, the most notable information was crammed into a subordinate clause and used the fact that.

Don’t underestimate the Reader. **He can decide for himself whether having eight manicured gardens qualifies as remarkable. You’re wasting his time by saying it’s an aspect of the park.** The Reader can connect one idea to the next without the help of in addition to. And he understands that the Hawaiian lifestyle is leisurely and tolerant is a generalization and subject to debate—no disclaimers required.

In other words, fatty insertions that can seem so meaningful when we’re writing are often unnecessary at best and insufferable at worst. When in doubt, take them out. Redundancies can be hard to spot. Vigilance is your best defense. Consider this sentence:

- Flu viruses are known to be notoriously unpredictable.

We’ve seen how manner adverbs can create redundancies. But in this sentence, which I found in a Los Angeles Times article, the adverb isn’t the problem.

Notoriously, by definition, means that something is well-known. Therefore, it’s redundant with are known. But this adverb is pulling its weight and then some. It tells us in a single word that flu viruses are known for something. But because its definition also carries a negative connotation, notoriously adds extra information. The unpredictability of flu viruses isn’t just famous, it’s famously bad. That’s why I suspect that,
with a little more time or coffee, the copyeditor would have chopped out known to be, leaving just

- Flu viruses are notoriously unpredictable.

Oh, and about those demons known as run-on sentences and comma splices: don’t let the jargon intimidate you. You’ve already mastered far tougher concepts. Just note, for the record, **a run-on sentence fails to properly link its clauses:**

- Elephants are large they eat foliage.

A comma splice, really just a type of run-on sentence, uses commas to link clauses that should stand on their own as sentences or at least be separated with a semicolon or conjunction:

- Elephants are large, they eat foliage.

Both are easy to fix. Either make each clause a separate sentence, find some conjunction that can get the job done, or consider a semicolon:

- Elephants are large. They eat foliage. 
- Elephants are large; they eat foliage. 
- Elephants are large, and they eat foliage. 
- Elephants are large because they eat foliage

To fix flabby writing, watch out for words or little clusters of words that work well in speech but that don’t translate well to the written word. **Consider first whether you can cut them out altogether.** If not, look for ways to **streamline**: *In addition to the fact that tuition* is affordable might be replaced with just also. Some fatty insertions can be cut altogether. For his part, as director for the Center for Computer Security, Brady emphasizes training says no less if you chop out for his part.

Also, watch out for sentences too cowardly to come out and say something or whose wording is just too convoluted. **Remember that your goal is not fewer words, but economy of words.**



## 20. The major overhaul: Streamlining even the most problematic sentences 

In previous chapters, we’ve seen some simple ways to pare down inefficient sentences. But some sentences have deeper structural problems that are harder to identify and harder to fix. Luckily, you now have enough grammar under your belt to tackle any problem that can **muck up** a sentence.
Whenever you’re faced with a problem sentence, start by looking for its main clause—that is, its main subject and verb:

- This intimate and discerning depiction of the impact of migration on families left behind by loved ones who travel north emerges as a nuanced portrait of “the other side” of the immigration story.



This is a description of a movie in a film festival. Movie loglines are tough to write because they’re supposed to be kept to just one or two sentences. But this sentence appeared in a brochure—not in a pitch to a
Hollywood executive. So the writer had the elbow room to improve it. The question, of course, is how?
Start by isolating the main subject, depiction, and verb, emerges. So, at its heart, our sentence is

- This depiction emerges.

That’s a complete sentence. But is it a complete thought? Does it tell the Reader what to expect from this movie? Not even close. Clearly, we need some of that other stuff. For example, depiction, on its own, is painfully devoid of any solid information. Also, a depiction is always a depiction of something. That’s where the trouble began for the writer**. A prepositional phrase—an of phrase—was needed just to make sense of the subject**.

Then there’s emerges. This is an intransitive verb, so it doesn’t need an object. But it sure needs something. Hence the *as* that follows. This *as* creates a vehicle to help tell the Reader what, exactly, depiction is doing in
this sentence. The depiction is not just emerging—coming out of a hole or coming into the spotlight. It’s emerging as something. **We can presume that by emerging as, the writer means “reveals itself to be” or “comes to be” or “turns out to be” or “becomes.” In other words, emerges as is the writer’s substitute for is.** Yes, it’s more creative than is, but **that creativity comes at too high a price**. We already have a subject that needs a prepositional phrase to make sense. Now we’re using a verb that also
needs a prepositional phrase to make sense. (Note: As is often a conjunction. But in our sentence it’s a preposition. We know this because subordinating conjunctions like as introduce whole clauses but prepositions take objects—nouns or pronouns, like portrait.) To mean anything at all, our main clause must be expanded to

- This depiction of the impact of migration emerges as a nuanced portrait.

*Impact* is the object of a preposition in a prepositional phrase. Then impact is followed by its own prepositional phrase, of migration, yet impact is still begging for yet another prepositional phrase. Impacts are usually **impacts on someone or something**. Hence on families in the writer’s original:

- of the impact of migration on families

What families? Well, we have a modifier to answer that. It’s the participial phrase left behind. But that modifier requires a prepositional phrase, by loved ones. And loved ones, the object of the preposition by,
takes as a modifier the relative clause who travel north. Each of the modifying phrases and clauses is underlined here: 

- This depiction of the impact of migration on families left behind by loved ones who travel north

  

All that comes before we even get to the verb.
Then, after the verb emerges, which requires its own prepositional phrase, as a portrait, we still need two more prepositional phrases: of “the other side” and of the immigration story:

- emerges as a portrait of “the other side” of the immigration story

After all that, the writer squeezed in three adjectives: intimate and discerning before depiction and nuanced before portrait.
Sift through all the clutter in this sentence and you find that the very heart—the very point of our main clause—is

- This depiction is a portrait

That’s a whole lotta nuthin’. It’s like saying this picture is an image, this
person is a man, or this car is a vehicle. A total waste of words that, ironically, happened in a place where economy of words was paramount.

The main clause contained no new information. The substantive stuff was all crammed into prepositional phrases and other sentence accessories.

Despite all these problems, the writer did a pretty impressive job of getting the point across. We know what the film is about and we even get a sense of mood. But how could we do better?

Well, our main clause contains both a troublesome noun and a troublesome verb. Let’s try replacing them. **Whenever you’re struggling with a vague or troublesome noun, first consider the simplest alternatives**. Ask yourself, what is this thing we’re talking about? **This depiction referred to a film. Emerges really referred to a state of being.** Simplify them and you get:

- This film depicts.

Now we have a more tangible (if more pedestrian) subject and a more action-oriented verb. If we drop this into the first part of our sentence, we end up with something like this:

- This intimate and discerning film depicts the impact of migration on families left behind by loved ones who travel north.

But we have this left over from the original:

- a nuanced portrait of “the other side” of the immigration story

What can we do with this leftover information? We could tack it on:

- This intimate and discerning film depicts the impact of migration on families left behind by loved ones who travel north—a nuanced portrait of “the other side” of the immigration story.

Not bad. But the crux of our sentence is now:

- This film depicts the impact and is a portrait.

So we’re still making the hollow statement this film is a portrait. We could break our sentence into two, thereby giving portrait a real job to do:

- This intimate and discerning film depicts the impact of migration on families left behind by loved ones who travel north. It is a nuanced portrait of “the other side” of the immigration story.

Or we could use the coordinator *and* and another verb like *forms* to keep everything in a single sentence:

- This intimate and discerning film depicts the impact of migration on families left behind by loved ones who travel north and forms a nuanced portrait of “the other side” of the immigration story.

Or better yet we could avoid the redundancy of this film forms a portrait by making portrait our main subject:

- This intimate, discerning, and nuanced portrait of “the other side” of the immigration story depicts the impact on families left behind by loved ones who travel north.

Now we can see that we sure did have a lot of adjectives offering commentary on this film. Maybe we can do without one. For example, discerning surely meant something important to the writer. But it doesn’t
mean much to a Reader. If we’re voting one of them off the island, that would be my pick:

- This intimate and nuanced portrait of “the other side” of the immigration story depicts the impact on families left behind by loved ones who travel north.

We might even ditch another adjective:

- This intimate portrait of “the other side” of the immigration story depicts the impact on families left behind by loved ones who travel north.

I like this much better. It still has stacked modifiers—four prepositional phrases and a relative clause. It still has impact on. But these no longer seem like problems because the noise around them has been silenced.

And this isn’t the only alternative. Your grammar skills open up a world of choices:

- By looking at the families left behind when loved ones travel north, this intimate and discerning film shows the other side of the immigration story.
- Film Name Unknown is an intimate portrait of the families whose loved ones move north to find work.
- We’ve all heard the stories of Mexican nationals who travel north to find work. But what about the families they leave behind? The intimate and nuanced Film Name Unknown tells their stories.
- When Jose left Guatemala to find work in the United States, he did it for his family. Little did he know the **ripple effect that his absence would create**.

Some of these examples wouldn’t work. The last two especially don’t have the tone of film festival movie descriptions. But these examples help us see **the wide range of possibilities that open up** once we get to the heart of a sentence and consider what, exactly, we’re trying to say.
