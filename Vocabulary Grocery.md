<Another year gone….>[http://english-speak-english.com/another-year-gone/]

On this last day of the year it can be instructive to take stock of what’s happening around the world. While many of us may live in relative peace and comfort, there are many people who do not. Given the current state of global affairs, I expect 2019 to be a pretty wild ride. The following are presented in no particular order of importance.

- be instructive
- live in relative peace and comfort

- take stock of what's happening ... = examine, see, list

Here’s a link to take a reading of some important points in the socio-political landscape of America.

It’s bad enough the the United States has allowed upwards of 20 million illegal aliens into the country, but this link shares details from FBI statistics that indicate roughly 8 million of those here illegally attempted to buy guns…illegally! To those politicians who assert the answer is “we need better gun control laws”, I say fuck-off and die! We need effective enforcement of border security. Limiting the rights of law-abiding citizens will do nothing to make us safer. Neither will it limit criminals from accessing firearms.



- it's bad enough that the ....
- upwards of : more than : in excess of <they cost upwards of $25>
- indicate 
- roughly
- To those ... who assert the answer  is "...", I say ...
- effective enforcement of 
- Doing sth. will do nothing to ..... Neither will it  do sth...



Democrats in congress seem to be more interested in blaming Russia for anything that ails the U.S.A., than fixing the problems under their noses. Now that their party has taken a majority in the House of (non) Representatives, it seems Trump may have his hands tied in terms of getting any further policy changes passed. Additionally, tension between Russia and the U.S. over the events in Ukraine has a chance of kicking off a nasty conflict between these two old rivals…..With respect to American or, any Western European country, I have to ask, what strategic interest / value does Ukraine hold? The “Deep State” wants more war….for more peace, of course.

- ail: If something ails a group or area of activity, it is a problem or source of trouble for that group or for people involved in that activity.

The rot in higher education continued in 2018. Here are the Top-10 Most Outrageous Stories for the year.

  *The country's leaders are unwilling to take unpopular measures to stop the rot.* 

- outrageous:  If you describe something as outrageous, you are emphasizing that it is unacceptable or very shocking.



This link gives a snapshot look at the financial markets for the final day of trading in 2018. After pulling back in the earlier part of the year, gold has regained some of it’s luster currently trading at $1,282.  Oddly, silver remains lagging at $15.46. Perhaps it’s a good time to buy a little silver, while the price is still relatively low.



- give a snapshot look at ... 

- pull back  : If someone pulls back from an action, they decide not to do it or continue with it, because it could have bad consequences. 

- luster:  a superficial attractiveness or appearance of excellence . Gold has regained some of it's luster currently trading at  $1,282.

All over South America there are troubles; Argentina is mired in corruption. Brazil endures post-election problems, Chile is among many nations that continue to grapple with the world-wide problem of pedophile priests. Columbia continues to address their violent crime problems. Peru’s President Moreno deals with problems his administration inherited. Venezuela is the latest shining example of the failures of Socialism.

The Euro-project seems in more peril than ever, as the ‘Yellow-vests”, or Gilets Juanes…..as they are called in France, not satisfied with Macron’s concessions, continue to riot. He is perceived by the populous as being an elitist / Globalist and out-of-touch with the people. These protests are not isolated to Paris. They are widespread across the nation of France and give no indication of abetting anytime soon. So pervasive are these protests that the French government has considered declaring a national emergency. And all across the Euro-zone the migration issues is causing big problems. I suspect that Europe passed the point of being able to peacefully recover her social, historical and religious identity. They let the barbarians inside the gate.

- peril: exposure to the risk of being injured, destroyed, or lost : DANGER .   e.g. fire put the city in peril> 

  Euro-project seems in more peril than ever.

- barbarians: In former times, barbarians were people from other countries who were thought to be uncivilized and violent. 
  The Roman Empire was overrun by Nordic barbarians

- let the barbarians inside the gate.



Also, on the other side of the pond, Brexit seems in peril. It appears that Italy is going through what Greece experienced not too long ago, with respect to the ongoing economic issues between their country and the European Central Committee. Many Germans have had enough of the Merkel regime, thus she has declined to seek reelection, but not before she declared that “nation-states should give up some of their sovereignty“. Here is a report that cites impending changes to the German economy. The Irish Times files this report on some more of the unsettling events of the past twelve months.

- sb is going though...., with respect to the ongoing ... issues....

- Many Germans have had enough of the Merkel regime, thus...

Meanwhile, President Trump addressed the United Nations and informed that “the U.S. rejects the ideology of Globalism“. He may need to inform the other half of the country who are apparently a-okay with the notion of world governance. As well, leaders of the Visegrad nations (Hungary, Czech Republic, Austria, Poland and Slovakia) have formally and firmly asserted their rejection of Communism and the Euro-Central Committee’s demands to import massive numbers of Mohammedans from Africa and elsewhere. I’m glad that some leaders on the international stage have not lost all ability to exercise reason and logic.

- address sb = give speech to sb

- reject the ideology of ..

- who *are apparently **a-okay with** the notion* of world governance.

Religious freedom suffers another setback in Turkey. How is Turkey an ally of Western governments? Another ally of the U.S. government and long time recipient of U.S. military hardware, Saudi Arabia, had beheaded a total of 48 people in the first four months of this year. It’s hard to keep up with death counts of these barbaric regimes, but when beheadings aren’t good enough, these savages have used crucifixion in a pinch. Most of these “criminals” were non-violent offenders. Why is the United States allied with such backward and brutal thugs? What is the difference between the Saudis and the Iranians?

- suffer another setback in sth. 
  A setback is an event that delays your progress or reverses some of the progress that you have made. 

- an ally of western government

- savages = barbarians
- crucifixion = extreme and painful punishment, affliction, or suffering

I’m not particularly enamored with author Andrew Sullivan, but I think he is right about the Neo-Conservative response to Trumps plan for getting U.S. troops out of Syria and Afghanistan. The Establishment Will Never Say No to a War. This link makes the argument that Syria Was Never a Just War. …..So why are we there?



- enamored with sb =   feel a strong or excessive interest or fascination 
- Establishment <in capitalized : a controlling group 
- the link makes the argument that ...



As of December 22, the most recent outbreak of the Ebola virus, in Democratic Republic of Congo has taken the lives of 692 (known) souls. Record keeping is not the best in that part of the world, so the numbers of possibly infected people is basically a guess….and it could be much, much higher. Don’t eat bush-meat and run the other way if you see an African with symptoms of hemorrhagic fever coming your way! The communists under Cyril Ramaphosa continue to steal land, foment injustice and murder white land-owners in South Africa….and not much word of it in the news.

- As of Dec.22, the most recent

- continue to hold the title of ...when it comes to sth...
- talks seem to have stalled.  stall: a ruse to deceive or delay



From Japan comes this headline that speaks volumes about the idiocy of their current crop of leaders; Japanese cybersecurity minister admits he has never used a computer! You simply can not make this stuff up! Let us also not forget about Fukushima. It’s been seven years since the nuclear disaster that occurred at that power plant and radioactive waste continues to pour into the Pacific Ocean.



- speak volumes about : to provide a lot of information about something 

- idiocy of : something notably stupid or foolish

-  cybersecurity

- You simply can not make this stuff up = you have to believe it is true.

   make something up. —. to say or write something that is not true: I made up an excuse because I didn't want to go. 

- Let us also not forget about Fukushima
- radioactive waste continues to pour into the Pacific Ocean.



Further south in the Pacific, Java, near the Krakatoa Volcano that erupted recently, has resulted in the deaths of more than 400 hundred with many more still unaccounted for. Living on an island gives one little choice of avoiding the effects of periodic seismic shifts, volcanoes and tsunamis.

- with many still unaccounted for. 
-  avoiding the effects of periodic seismic shifts, volcanoes and tsunamis.



All I can say is, pray for peace and for justice for the oppressed. Be thankful for all you have. Keep your friends and family close. Let them know you love them. Hope for the best in the coming year and buy more ammo.

- oppressed: people who re oppressed are treated cruelly or are prevented from having the same opportunities, freedom, and benefits as others. 
  Before they took power, they felt oppressed by the white English speakers who controlled things. 

- ammo: Ammo is ammunition for guns and other weapons. (INFORMAL)

- My hugs to your family

Yes--the real meaning of Christmas, is remembering those in need and doing something for them. Sending children cards and gifts is a really wonderful thing to do.

- pedestrian mall

Wow--in the US, Santa flies around in a sleigh.  I wish you and your wife a SUPER 2019 with great health and success!

- sparse : Something that is sparse is small in number or amount and spread out over an area.  / of few and scattered elements especially : not thickly grown or settled

  A cymbal is a flat circular brass object that is used as a musical instrument. You hit it with a stick or hit two cymbals together, making a loud noise. 

- Ladybugs  that move~
- A tin soldier that bangs on a drum!

With the new year, many people want to make a new plan. A fresh start. Why not? It’s a great time to do something new, right?! But instead of DOING something…what about FINDING something?

Below is a list of “things” that people spend YEARS looking for. Some people never find them. What about you? I still have a LOT of “things” to find, but I think I have found a few! You can see them in blue.

FIND YOUR...

- Have you found your bliss? Your happiness

- Find your calling—the job that feels natural to you

  -  YES! For me, teaching!

- Find your destiny—God’s purpose for you OR your life according to the stars (astrology)

- Find your edge—your advantage that other people don’t have

  - Yes! I think~ The ability to explain difficult things EASILY to people

- Find your fate—your destiny

- Find your grind—the work (job) that is best for you

  - Yes! Working for myself online at home!

  - grind : dreary, monotonous, or difficult labor, study, or routine b : one who works or studies excessively* 

- Find your groove—*the lifestyle that is perfect for you*. 
  - Yes! The country life—like a farmer with a computer!
  - groove: a fixed routine : RUT b : a situation suited to one's abilities or interests : NICHE 

​      

- Find your passion—something you LOVE doing

- Find your purpose—your reason for living
  - Yes, I think. To help people by making them smile~

- Find your spirit animal—the animal you resemble in your daily life

- Find your style—the “look” (appearance) that is best for you

- Find your talent—a skill that you’re naturally good at
- Find your voice—the ability to express your thoughts and feelings easily
- Find your way—the path towards a happy/successful life
- Find your Zen—an inner peace where you are able to block out the rest of the world!

That’s it for today…**a little philosophical!!**

LME Lesson 4 <http://archive.aweber.com/ddm_membership/HYHUZ/h/English_Lesson_4_Enjoy_it.htm>

**TO LEARN: reddit, lurk, nootropics, subreddit,  AMA**

I highly recommend you check out reddit FOR YOUR ENGLISH!

Reddit.com is the 16th most popular website in the WORLD! Reddit is a place where you can find every type of subject and talk about it with other people. **Or you can “lurk”. To lurk means to “just watch”!!**

I go to reddit to find out information about “nootropics”. Nootropics are vitamins and foods and herbs that I can eat which help my BRAIN function better! Another “subreddit’ (subject in reddit) that I like is ELI5.ELI5 is short for “ExplainLikeImFive” or “Explain (difficult subject) as though I’m a five-year-old child”!!

In the ELI5 subreddit, people ask questions about science (LOTS of science), politics, religion or ANY kind of silly question that we don’t understand the answer to.

 That brings me to AMA. AMAs started on reddit—AMA stands for “Ask Me Anything”! Experts and politicians and **celebrities use AMAs to help people, to get to know people, and to satisfy people’s curiosities!**

Nowadays you can find AMAs on Twitter, Facebook, Periscope…**pretty much everywhere on the internet**!

That’s it for today! **A quick recap**: reddit…lurk…nootropics…subreddit…AMA

- A quick recap: 

- Have a super weekend!


**Book review about  [The Minimalist Home: A Room-by-Room Guide to a Decluttered, Refocused Life]**

This is an excellent book--logical, sensible, and worth reading. The one thing missing is "how" to get rid of things. Certain items, like used clothing, are covered, but the problem comes with family heirlooms you no longer want (and no one else does, either) or things, like valuable silver, that you can't just put in the trash. I've tried auctioneers (they don't want to deal with these things any more than you do), consignment shops (they tell me to come and get them), and there they are again, back in my house. What we need next is a book that really focuses on places to send things, not necessarily for monetary gain, but to ensure they don't end up in a landfill. My late mother-in-law used to say that you spend the first half of your life acquiring things and the next half trying to get rid of them. She was right. You can't just toss a two-hundred year old fish slice. So where do you send it?

- family heirlooms 
  An heirloom is an ornament or other object that has  belonged to a family for a very long time and that has been handed down from one  generation to another.

- consignment  shops: a dealer who pays only for what is  sold and who may return what is unsold <goods shipped on consignment*>

- landfill: A landfill is a large deep hole in which very large amounts of rubbish are buried

- you spend the first half of your life acquiring things and the next half trying to get rid of them

- You can't just toss a two-hundred year old fish slice. 

- tackle my mental and physical materialistic issues: 

  If you tackle a difficult problem or task, you deal with it in a very determined or efficient way. 



First off let me say I love Joshua Becker...have been following him for years. I have his first book and thoroughly loved it so was looking forward to this new book. Boy I was disappointed. The book is described as “a room by room guide to a decluttered refocused life.” Nothing could be further from the truth...every chapter(room) said the same thing-get rid of what you don’t want, keep what you love. Not very inspiring! If you preordered the book and are on Joshua's email list, you also received some online materials(minimizing checklist and a step by step minimizing checklist) I found those to be way more helpful, informative, and inspiring than the book itself. In fact I printed them out and put them in protective sheets in a folder so I can refer to them over and over. In those checklists he lists actual ITEMS to declutter and is much more specific as to how to proceed with your decluttering. I still think Joshua’s methods of decluttering and simplifying are the best-this book just fell short.

- refer to them over and over
- how to proceed with your decluttering. 



Many thanks to NetGalley, Waterbrook and Multnomah, and Joshua Becker for an ARC in exchange for an honest review. My opinions are 100% my own and independent of receiving an advanced copy.

Joshua Becker has been in the “minimal” business for about 10 years. He has a website where you can get lots of tips and advice, including a newsletter sent to your inbox every so often. He has written other books but this one is sort of the culmination of his life’s work. He has been on TV, speaks all over and I have been following him for the past couple of years.

- every so often: once in a while; occasionally

- this one is sort of the culmination of his life’s work.


 In today’s **world of massive consumerism**, we can all use a dose of paring down and keeping things simple. We all have too much stuff. **We are promoted, advertised, propagandized into thinking that it’s all stuff we need, what we have isn’t the right stuff and that the more stuff we have the happier we will be.** This has been going on for years, I mean George Carlin had a bit about “Stuff” in the early 80’s. So I was excited to read what Becker had to say on what he promotes as a step by step, comprehensive room-by-room guide to decluttering your home and your life.



- massive consumerism
- pare down:   to trim off an outside, excess, or irregular part. Pare down expenses
- be promoted, advertised, propagandized into thinking that.... 

Ugh - what an awful read. First I felt like his tone was so condescending. I couldn’t take it. Obviously I have a lot of stuff - that’s why I’m reading this book. He would repeat himself, ad nauseam, throughout the whole book. 

- his tone was so condescending. I couldn't take it.

- ad nauseam:  to a sickening or excessive degree


There wasn’t any comprehensive guide - again, he would repeat the same thing over and over for each room, literally the same steps - for each room! Why bother going through each room, listing all of the possible things you might have accumulated, telling me “get rid of what you don’t use or don’t need”. Obviously I knew that much! I don’t need a book for that. I was hoping for some insight, maybe some ideas that I hadn’t thought of to help declutter, some instructions. There was no real guidance other than “don’t do it” for lasting change. 

- there was no sth. other than ...



Then, don’t tell me how my life is going to change, I will become richer, have a fabulous job, help the poor, have more time, blah blah blah, just because you told me to get rid of some stuff. I didn’t buy any of it. I have decluttered before and none of those things have happened to me. The “real life” examples were ridiculous, laughable. Look, I believe in keeping a home without a lot of junk. Nobody needs piles of clothes, lots of knick-knacks, and yes, you should keep those things that mean something to you. 

- I didn't buy any of it.

- knick-knacks:  small objects which people keep as ornaments or toys, rather than for a particular use. 
  e.g. Her flat is spilling over with knick-knacks. 

You shouldn’t get sucked into marketing ideas of having the latest, greatest and best thing out there, which will go out of date and then you need something new. I also happen to live with a (mild case) hoarder, who believes every rock, piece of junk, paper, etc. is extremely important and sentimental and will not throw out anything. 

- get sucked into marketing ideas of ...
- out there 
- (mild case) 
- hoarder: a person loving accumulating items. 
- Sentimental means relating to or involving feelings such as pity or love, especially for things in the past. 
  e.g. Our paintings and photographs are of sentimental value only. 
  e.g. Perhaps he has returned for sentimental reasons. 



So according to Becker, those are the things to keep. Not helpful. But without something new or real to add to the discussion, don’t fill up a book with one idea. My advice is don’t add one more book to your bookshelf with this one.

- fill up: make full

  If you fill up or fill yourself up with food, you eat so much that you do not feel hungry

Beginning this year (2019) I will try and post a monthly topic of “special difficulties” in the English language. Words and phrases that are often confused or misused will be the primary focus, **but there may be other pointers that come up too.**

These words and phrases are worth saving in your vocabulary notebook for future reference.

Words often confused or misused.

Lesson 1

A) Phrases with the word **way**.

**In the way:** Please move this chair. It’s in the way. Do your work in the way I have shown you.

**On the way**: I bought a magazine on the way to the station.

**In this way:** He saves old envelopes. In this way, he has collected a great many stamps.

**By the way**: By the way, have you seen Sally?

**In a way:** In a way, It is an important film.  (to some degree)

The delivery man knocked at my door and he rang the doorbell.
I **knocked the vase off the table** and broke it.
He always **knocks off** at six o’clock on Fridays. (He finishes his work.)
The shop manager **knocked 10% off** the bill. (Reduced the price by 10%.)
A car knocked the boy over.. (It hit him and made him fall.)
The older boxer **knocked out** the younger fighter in the first round. (Hit him so hard that he caused the fighter to lose consciousness.)

- vase:  A vase is a jar, usually made of glass or pottery, used for holding cut flowers or as an ornament.

- Get ready for some serious wet weather coming your way!

[Forget El Nino, StormFest Is about To Hit The West Coast] <https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-01-04/forget-el-nino-stormfest-about-hit-west-coast>

Via Cliff Mass Weather & Climate blog,

Things often calm down after January 1 during El Nino years... but not this year... with the U.S. West Coast from central California to Washington State about to be pummeled by a series of storms.   Rain, snow, wind?  Plenty for everyone.

-  pummeled

A view of the latest infrared satellite imagery shows an amazing line-up of one storm after another stretching way into the Pacific.  A traffic jam of storms.

- infrared infrared  
  Infrared radiation is similar to light but has a longer wavelength, so we cannot see it without special equipment

- line-up
- a traffic jam of storms

**Wind?**  You bet.  Each of these storms will bring strong, damaging winds to a favored area of the coastal zone and mountain peaks. 

There is a **silver lining** of all this action of course:  it will provide an immense amount of water to fill our reservoirs and enhance our snowpack, a **snowpack** that is now in pretty decent shape (see latest summary below).  Water resources should be fine next summer.

- Silver lining: If you talk about a silver lining, you are talking about something positive that comes out of a sad or unpleasant situation. 
  The fall in inflation is the silver lining of the prolonged recession. 
  N-SING
- in a decent shape

But all these facts on the ground and favorable forecasts don't stop some of Seattle's wacky local media from talking about drought for our region, with the Seattle Stranger being one of the worst (see below). 

- wacky:  absurdly or amusingly eccentric or irrational : CRAZY <e.g wacky ideas> <e.g. a wacky comedian> 

Facts should matter---apparently not at the Stranger.

- hedge : a calculatedly noncommittal or evasive statement

My BAD LUCK STREAK (long period of time of continuous bad luck) was caused by BAD DECISIONS that I made.

- streak:  An unbroken series, as of wins or losses

But my BAD LUCK STREAK started to end, also, because of GOOD DECISIONS that I made.

LME 10

It was a SUPER busy week for me with 11 LIVE classes on top of my regular schedule. UGH!!! So, I needed a day off!

I was talking to my neighbor this morning, and she said something really interesting. She said:

> We had guests over on Saturday and then so many visitors on Sunday.

 

After hearing that, I thought—what an excellent idea for a short email lesson!!

Guests VERSUS visitors

Actually, in daily English, many Americans sometimes use them the same. BUT, there is a simple difference

Guests—YOU invited!

Visitors—you did NOT invite!!

When I lived in Las Vegas, I would “**pay my mother a visit**” almost every day. Just for a few minutes. I never called her, I just went to her house.

Houseguests *(you can spell it as one word OR as two)* are guests that stay overnight. Sometimes it’s just one night…but sometimes it’s for several nights!

SMO : https://www.rohitbhargava.com/2006/08/5_rules_of_soci.html

What is Social Media Optimization?
Obviously, SMO has to do with social networks and their growing importance to business. This aspect of optimization deals with enhancing your company’s presence and online reputation through interactive communities—not just Facebook and Twitter, but also blogs, forums, and anywhere your business is mentioned or linked to socially.

Working with SMO can help you strengthen your brand and boost visibility, as well as generate leads and increase sales. Optimizing your social media builds both familiarity with and trust for your business, because consumers will see you not only mentioned, but recommended by others.

- mashup: 

- bogged down 
  If you get bogged down in something, it prevents you from making progress or getting something done. 
  But why get bogged down in legal details?. 
  Sometimes this fact is obscured because churches get so bogged down by unimportant rules.

A bog is an area of land which is very wet and muddy. 

bog as a verb: to cause to sink into or as if into a bog : IMPEDE, MIRE ― usually used with down 
intransitive verb : to become impeded or stuck ― usually used with down

- at 2ish

  It means "around that time". 7-ish just means show up around 7

- fine-tune


If  you fine-tune something, you make very small and precise changes to it in order  to make it as successful or effective as it possibly can be. 
We do not try  to fine-tune the economy on the basis of short-term predictions. 
Computers  allow the plans to be fine-tuned and to be altered quickly. 
VB 

- darn 
  You can say darn it to show that you are very annoyed about 
  something. (AM, INFORMAL) 
  OK, I admit it, it was me. But darn it, I was 
  right!

- committed: did, performed
- authorities: the police...(could also mean government officials)
- armed robbery : robbing a person/business with a weapon
- Much-publicized: highly advertised
- Work out: succeed, come to fruition

VB  

recuperate  : When you recuperate, you recover your health or strength after you have been ill or injured. 
I went away to the country to recuperate. 
He is recuperating from a serious back injury. = recover =>recuperation 
Leonard was very pleased with his powers of recuperation.

LME 11http://archive.aweber.com/ddm_membership/7kX1J/h/Better_LATE_than_NEVER_So.htm

STARTING something...is actually really easy.

BUT maintaining something...not so easy.

And finishing something...even more difficult.

We are now into our second week of 2019. How are you doing? Are you maintaining your goals?!

Did you forget to start?!!

It is NEVER to late to start. But don't delay too long.

What is EASIER than STARTING?

DELAYING!!

Remember, the longer you delay, the more difficult it is to start. And if you never start...


You'll never be better.

Better LATE than NEVER.

Start today. Maintain. Go to the finish!



The man in the picture is a priest at the “Hoshoku Shrine”. It's NOT me!! 

Every year we ask him to come over to my house. He purifies our home to ward off bad luck like natural disasters.

- shrine

A shrine is a place that people visit and treat with respect because it is connected with a dead person or with dead people that they want to remember.

- ward off:  To ward off a danger or illness means to prevent it from affecting you or harming you

There’re lots of offerings to the deity of the Hoshoku Shrine on the table: veggies ＆ rice for a huge harvest, dried squid & grilled dried fish to bring good luck.

- A deity is a god or goddess. (FORMAL)

This is the room where the family Buddhist altar is placed.



- altar  1.altar altars  An altar is a holy table in a church or temple. 
  ...the high altar at Chichester Cathedral 
- .folly follies 
  If you say that a particular action or way of behaving is folly or a folly, you mean that it is foolish. 
  It's sheer folly to build nuclear power stations in a country that has dozens of earthquakes every year. 

Can you see the little portable shrine (upper left)? In that shrine, three deities are enshrined: the goddess of the sun, a food-related deity & this area’s protective deity. 

- enshrined:   to enclose in or as if in a shrine 
  2 : to preserve or cherish as sacred : Her memory is ~d in his heart.

We have lots of deities in Japan.

 Thank you for giving me a shout-out on the LME radio show. I’m very grateful to learn a deeper meaning of the lyrics.

- shout out : a brief expression of greeting or praise given especially on a broadcast or audio recording

Snow has come. Gas mileage is getting worse~ In the car “Shape of my Heart” is playing. It's not so cold outside, minus two degrees Celsius. (^_-)

Lesson 12: Nostalgic Containers?! Yes...what do you think?http://archive.aweber.com/ddm_membership/FnsoJ/h/Lesson_12_Nostalgic.htm

In our current **DDM 545**, we ran into two really interesting things:

When I was a kid, those two things were ubiquitous containers for knickknacks—little things that we didn’t want to throw away! They were EVERYWHERE! And people used them to store EVERYTHING! Everything small!

In nearly every garage you could find coffee cans full of nails and nuts and bolts, they’d be full of change, and they made great containers for pens and pencils.

Cigar boxes—they were PERFECT for my baseball and football card collections! And my stamp collection. And for marbles and crayons and anything else that wasn’t too heavy! And they looked cool on a bookshelf plus you could stack them. I loved them!

But nowadays…coffee comes in resealable bags. Or plastic containers.

**And with the knowledge of the bad effects of smoking**, fewer and fewer people are buying boxes of cigars. I don’t think I’ve seen a box of cigars in a store in decades! I guess that’s a good thing…

**But the nostalgia—the sweet memories that I have about those things!** By just seeing those containers, I can smell my dad’s coffee, I can smell my grandpa’s cigar! I can visualize my coins~ I can visualize my baseball cards~

Good memories~

What about you? Did you ever use containers like those? **What sort of knickknacks did you store** in them? Do you still have them? What other things did we use as containers?

LME 13 http://archive.aweber.com/ddm_membership/5xaNJ/h/Lesson_13_Should_you_read.htm Should you read English OUT LOUD?

When reading in English, is it a good idea to read out loud? NO! Unless you have very good pronunciation, read to yourself!

 Yes, the opposite of “read out loud” is “read to yourself”!

Why? What happens when you read out loud?

If a student's pronunciation is “bad”, he will make his “bad” pronunciation stronger! Your eyes and mind are filled with English, but let your mouth and ears relax.
Reading SPEED will slow down a LOT! Reading to yourself is MUCH faster than reading aloud.
Your coworkers, classmates, friends and family will be ANNOYED!! It’s true!

Additionally, SPOKEN language is different from WRITTEN language.  We use many more “big words” when writing to be more precise. When we speak, however, we use easier words to be more efficient.

 One of America’s most influential writers was William Faulkner. Here’s an **excerpt** from one of his most famous novels called A Fable. Try reading it out loud

- excerpt: a passage (as from a book or musical composition) selected, performed, or copied : EXTRACT

Oh my god!! Did you give up? I stopped in the middle!! Books use more $10-words (big words) than we use when speaking. By trying to say them out loud, you will CUT YOUR FLOW—you will lose your rhythm and your speed will slow!

When I mispronounced a word, some people would smile and imitate the word just like I said. It embarrassed me and made me SO mad!! Again, it happens in every language, in every country.

If a person has bad pronunciation in a professional situation, it makes them sound “less intelligent”.  People might not want to listen to the speaker... Worse...the native speaker might focus more on your ACCENT than on what you are saying~~

After three days, you will stink

- stink: to be extremely bad or unpleasant eg<eg. the performance stank> that news really stinks>

Pittock Mansion

Built in 1914, Pittock Mansion is full of rich history of one of Portland's first families, the Pittocks. It is the perfect place to discover how Portland became what it is today.

Henry Pittock and future wife Georgiana Burton both crossed the ORGEGON Trail, separately, in the 1850s. Henry built his fortune as the publisher of The Oregonian newspaper, while Georgiana raised a family and funds for local charities. Together, the Pittocks helped transform Portland from small "stumptown" to bustling modern city. 

Goeorgiana and Henry lived in Pittock Mansion until their deaths in 1918 and 1919. In 1958, the last family members moved out and then mansion suffered damage in the 1962 Columbus Day Storm. Portlanders launched a fundraising campaign to save it, and in 1965 a restored Pittock Mansion opened to the public



http://pittockmansion.org/our-story/history/

BUILDING A LIFE, BUILDING PORTLAND

Henry Pittock (c.1834-1919) was born in London, England but grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1853, when Henry was 19, he headed west on the Oregon Trail **to seek his fortune**. A year later, his future wife Georgiana Burton (c.1845-1918) left Missouri with her family and headed west as well. When Henry and Georgiana arrived in the area, Portland was a frontier “stumptown” competing with Oregon City to become the major trade and industrial center for the region.

- stump: A stump is a small part of something that remains when the rest of it has been removed or broken off. 
  If you have a tree stump, check it for fungus



Henry found work as a typesetter at [*The Oregonian*](http://www.oregonlive.com/) at a time when the newspaper industry was **financially risky and fiercely competitive.** More than 30 newspapers **were launched in** Portland during this period. On June 20, 1860, Henry and Georgiana married and five months later, he was given ownership of the paper **in exchange for back wages**. Henry went on to transform *The Oregonian* into a successful daily newspaper that is still printed today.

- back wages:  is the difference between what an employee was paid and the amount the person should have been paid. ... For example, if an employer unlawfully fires an employee, the employee might be due back wages for the time he or she was not allowed to work.

AN ADVENTUROUS LIFE

While best known for being a successful newspaper publisher, Henry Pittock also built a financial empire by investing in real estate, banking, railroads, steamboats, **sheep ranching**, silver mining, and the paper industry. He was **an avid outdoorsman**, bicycle enthusiast, and was among the first group to climb Mount Hood. Georgiana Pittock became a founder and fundraiser for many charities and cultural organizations, such as the Ladies Relief Society, Women’s Union, and the Martha Washington Home, a residence for single, **self-supporting** women.

BUILDING A GRACIOUS HOME

It wasn’t until the early 1900s that Henry Pittock started planning his “mansion on the hill” **on property that had panoramic views of Portland, the Willamette River, and the distant Cascade Mountains**. Construction began in 1912 and Henry and Georgiana moved into the home in 1914 with eight other members of the family. The couple only lived in the Mansion for roughly four years before they died. Family continued to live in the home into the 1950s. The last residents, grandson Peter Gantenbein and his father, Edward, moved out in 1958 and **put the Mansion up for sale**.

- a panoramic view of ... If you have a panoramic view, you can see a long way over a wide area. 
- put ... up for sale

The Mansion sat empty for four years and was hit by the Columbus Day Storm on October 12, 1962. **Hurricane-force winds** damaged roof tiles and window panes which then allowed water to infiltrate the Mansion. By 1964, the Mansion was in poor condition and developers expressed interest in **tearing it down** and turning the estate into a subdivision. **Dedicated citizens of Portland rallied and assisted the City in raising the funds to purchase the property for $225,000, which included $67,500 raised by citizens**.

- pane: A pane of glass is a flat sheet of glass in a window or door
- infiltrate
- turn into subdivision
- Dedicated: devoted to a cause, ideal, or purpose : adj.  ZEALOUS <a dedicated scholar> 
- rally: unite to support 

SAVING PITTOCK MANSION

The work needed to restore the Mansion and transform it from a private residence to a public space took 15 months. In 1965, Pittock Mansion opened to the public as a historic house museum.

In 1968, the nonprofit Pittock Mansion Society was formed to **take on the responsibility of** furnishing the Mansion, taking care of the collection, and providing educational activities.

PITTOCK MANSION TODAY

In 2007, the Society took over the day-to-day museum operations from [Portland Parks & Recreation](https://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/) and has been operating the historic house museum ever since.

The Pittock Mansion Society is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization whose mission is to **inspire understanding and stewardship of Portland history through Pittock Mansion**. The Society also works with Portland Parks & Recreation to maintain and preserve the historic buildings. All admissions, memberships, donations, grants, and museum store purchases go to **support Pittock Mansion and its mission.**

LME 15 <http://archive.aweber.com/ddm_membership/NV1oJ/h/Lesson_15_Americans_using.htm>

In our last DDM assignment we were studying part of a TED Talk.

TED Talks are really popular because of their GREAT subjects and their GREAT speakers. And our assignment was great. BUT…we ran into a phrase that caused a lot of students a problem.

more so

“more so” is MOST COMMONLY used as an adverbial. It’s equivalent to “even more” and typically includes the word “than”.

**Check these sentences out** **(all written by my students)****:**

- **Women** create stable societies more so than **men**.

- If you cover your **eyes**, your **hearing** ability is enhanced more so than ever.

- This band is popular **now** and is likely to become even more so in the **future**.

*We could easily replace* **MORE** *with \**LESS** or **EQUALLY**, which is why English dictionaries prefer to write it as TWO WORDS and not one word.*

 In those examples, we are using “more so” to **CONTRAST** A and B. It shows a difference between A and B. That is the CORRECT usage of “more so”!

**But…damn daily English!**

In the TED Talk we studied, “more so” was used to **ADD** to A and **NOT** to **CONTRAST**. In this situation, however, “**MOREOVER**” would be a better word to use, but Americans sometimes don’t care about the rules!!

 In this usage, “more so” is similar to:

Not only A, but also B 

In addition to A, there is also B

There is A, not to mention B

And an example with *moreover*:

Cooking my own food is cheap, moreover it’s healthier.

 **Check these out** **(one sentence from my student, one from TED and two from me!)****:**

- I realized that I wanted everyone to like me. More so I am a hypocrite.

  Hypocrite:  
  If you accuse someone of being a hypocrite, you mean that they pretend to have qualities, beliefs, or feelings that they do not really have. 
  The magazine wrongly suggested he was a liar and a hypocrite. 
  N-COUNT disapproval 

- She became a bassist, more so a musician.

  bassist: A bassist is someone who plays the bass guitar or the double bass. 

- I coach, more so I inspire.

- Cooking my own food is cheap, **moreso** it’s healthier.

*It is more acceptable (recently) to write “more so” as one word.*

*Still, most dictionaries will NOT acknowledge “moreso” as one word!*

Chances are, the American will understand you. **Especially if you add, “You know what I mean?” at the end of your sentence!!**

LME  <http://archive.aweber.com/ddm_membership/AFbx3/h/Buck_up_But_not_always_.htm>

Tough and resilient.

That's my neighbor. When I took that picture, it was 26 below 0 Celsius! No problem for that guy. He's a male deer--we call them bucks. 

We have an expression: **Buck up**!

It means, "be tough" or "be strong".

"Don't be weak". Be like a buck!

Our buck comes by every evening for some snacks. My wife gives them some feed--she likes having the deer around.

We don't usually see the bucks, though. The does (females) and yearlings (deer that are almost one year old) are the most common visitors.

So why has he been visiting? 

Because of the BRUTAL cold. While the deer can survive in the super cold weather, they don't want to waste much energy running around. 

SO...our FREE food is a great deal! He can come, eat and then go back to rest!

 **Even the toughest sometimes need help**.

The same goes with everything. You might think you don't need help. You might think getting help is weak.

You might think that it's better to do it yourself than to get help.

But that's not always true.

You might just be wasting your time. And other people's time, too.

Don't be too proud to NOT take help. At the same time, be happy when YOU can offer help, too!



When I was a kid, we had those containers, too. I kept cigar boxes to store "Bons Points" that my teacher gave me when I was either a good girl or if a had done a good job. After earning 10 bons points, we could exchange them for an image of animals or whatever. We still have coffee cans in France, especially for instant coffee. Yes, good memories of my childhood.



THIS is what I love about teaching English through DDM. How else could we come up with the subject of old coffee cans and cigar boxes? And how nice it is to know that as a child, just like me, we kept some treasure in these containers!! Thank you for sharing, Chantal!

 Hi Daisy! Oh...they all look SO delicious! You know, when I visited China (Hong Kong), I never saw anything like these dishes. And when I ate at nice Chinese restaurants in Korea, I never saw ANY of these dishes! If I go to China, you'll have to tell me exactly where to go. Food will be my top priority!!



 Hi, there!  I'm giving answers to the questions you asked me in the last newsletter. And I'm also attaching some additional pics... So here is my route! A short description...I took the train from Strel'na (my neighborhood) to a station called "Platform 68km." I was on the train with my MTB. The body of water is called "The Gulf of Finland." 2nd (pic). The weapons are from WWII 1941-1945 battles. 

 As to the lighthouse, it's a landmark but still active, you can see a light signal on top of it. And next to it is a modern ships' traffic control station. It was getting rather late so I decided skip food in order to catch train. All in all, it was a spontaneous adventure. I didn't plan it... The places were new for me, but I  really enjoyed visiting them! 

- spontaneous:  happening or arising without apparent external cause

Yes, like you, I have a desire to go on little adventures! I have a t-shirt that my wife bought me which says, **"Not all those who wander are lost"!** It's a quote from Tolkien! And it describes me. And I think it describes you, too!

I’m making drawings!!! The book’s coming along great. T**he freedom that will allow me to make any of my ideas a reality is within sight.** More updates soon^_^



Hmm!! I like me some STEAK!! **Did you cook it rare, medium or well-done?** This IS a test... 

15 minutes to change a flat? Wow! That's very quick! The last time I changed a flat...30 years ago!! And right now, with all the snow, I hope I don't have that problem!

 And your book is getting closer and closer to being finished! I, and I think all of the LME family...WE are really looking forward to it! And finally Luka! Luka has a LOT of fans, Matt. We get mail specifically directed towards Luka. Perhaps we should hire him to do some coaching!!

- Red moon...shaky Coach Shane!

Mikey was in his crib when all of the sudden deer started showing up in our backyard.

- crib: baby bed with high sides made of slats

He started screaming and hollering!

- holler: If you holler, you shout loudly. (mainly AM, INFORMAL) 
  The audience whooped and hollered. 

I think he got scared because the buck was chasing all the other deer away!!

He was probably angry at the buck!

That's it from me! I hope you guys have a super week. I'll be back in your INBOX tomorrow with another English lesson!

LME 17 http://archive.aweber.com/ddm_membership/E0Xu3/h/Lesson_17_Phrasal_Verb.htm

If you want to speak good “daily English”, there are FOUR things you must master.

Pronunciation & Phrasal verbs & Get/got usage & Pronouns 

 I talk about these four areas of daily English in my DDM classes all the time. They look easy—trust me, they’re NOT!!

Phrasal verbs are SIMPLY: an action verb + a preposition

Here are some examples…

- Shut up, shut down, shut off ,

- Go on, go through,  go by,

- Break out, break down, break up

Most of the time, the preposition (actually, it can function as a preposition OR an adverb—but that’s too much grammar!) gives extra information about the verb. And it’s usually easy to understand IN the context.

We have to know the context. We have to know the situation.

One phrasal verb can have SEVERAL possible meanings. An easy example would be GO DOWN:

- When the sun **goes down**, it’s much colder.   SINKS
- I told my wife I lost my job…that didn’t **go down** well. ACCEPTED *(received)*
- My weight has **gone down** since January first. DECREASED
- The game is **going down** at 7pm.  STARTING
- Your team is **going down**!  LOSING *(especially badly)*
- Let’s **go down** together. TRAVEL *(to the south, towards downtown, to a lower elevation)*
- My computer **went down** last night. BROKE *(stopped working)*
- Will Trump **go down** as a great president or a terrible president? BE REMEMBERED *(historically)*

That’s why I tell my students,

**Do NOT ignore phrasal verbs.**

But I also tell them,

**Do NOT memorize phrasal verbs.** 

What should you do?

**USE THEM!**

- Talk with Americans—catch the phrasal verbs.
- Listen to podcasts and radio shows in English—catch the phrasal verbs.
- Read articles and books—recognize the phrasal verbs.
- Watch TV shows and movies—catch the phrasal verbs.

Sound easy?

No, it’s not! And the really sad thing: if you don’t learn your phrasal verbs, you’ll continue to have a really hard time with daily English. The good news: Phrasal verbs are my specialty!

In EVERY DDM lesson we meet phrasal verbs. And we see them being used in a situation. The situation is easy after I explain it—and that makes the phrasal verb easy to understand.

And a few weeks later, we see the SAME phrasal verb again in a different situation. And my students recognize it and they can SEE that it is either the same or a bit different. And we talk about it.

Without a coach, without someone to ask, learning and mastering phrasal verbs is NOT easy!!

 Let me give you a QUIZ! In the following FOUR sentences, we can use the same phrasal verb (just change the tense). Can you figure out which is best? Don’t use a dictionary!! REAL LIFE, okay?

**Which of these phrasal verbs can go in ALL FOUR sentences below?**

**Go through**    **Bring up**    **Run down    Put off**

1. I                            a difficult time when my grandmother died.
2. Our proposal did not                      . But I promise that I’ll try again.
3. As a runner, I would                       3 or 4 pairs of running shoes every year.
4. I                            my resume and didn’t find any mistakes.

\1.    I **went through** a difficult time when my grandmother died. 

\2.    Our proposal did not **go through**. But I promise that I’ll try again.

\3.    As a runner, I would **go through** 3 or 4 pairs of running shoes every year.

\4.    I **went through** my resume and didn’t find any mistakes.

- caveat: A warning or caution: “A final caveat: Most experts feel that clients get unsatisfactory results when they don't specify clearly what they want” (Savvy). 
     b. A qualification or explanation.

e.g 2. Law. A formal notice filed by an interested party with a court or officer, requesting the postponement of a proceeding until the filer is heard.



When you speak English, we often have words that GO TOGETHER.

For example,

**Black and white**

I really like black and white photographs.

**Read and write**

In elementary school, they teach students to read and write.

**Suit and tie**

If a guy works for a bank, he should wear a suit and tie.

 

Now, what’s IMPORTANT with these pairs of words—you MUST say them in that order! If you say “a white and black photograph”, people will look at you STRANGE!

 Of course, it is possible to switch the order—there’s nothing wrong contextually—but native speakers commonly use THE SAME ORDER!!

So, here’s your quiz: Choose the correct order!

- For breakfast I love having  bacon and eggs. 

- For dinner, though, I’m a meat and potatoes  guy! 

- Do you have a  pen or pencil ?

- I need new  pots and pans  for my kitchen.

- Put on your shoes and socks                        .   

- I work outside rain or shine                        .   

- Life has its  ups and downs                    .

- After getting hit, his eye turned  black and blue                            .

- Do you want any salt and pepper on your eggs?

- Hotels are nice, but I prefer a quaint bed and breakfast  much more.
  - Something that is quaint is attractive because it is unusual and rather old-fashioned. 
    ...a small, quaint town with narrow streets and traditional half-timbered houses... 

The answers are [HERE](https://parmyproductionsllc.box.com/s/s5ckov9t3fpcpm8pw5imz53fieu5fxxh)!

**A quick recap:** **black and white****,** **read and write****,** **suit and tie****,** **+10 more pairs**

 I am in awe that you have so much grit to self-teach yourself UX design. 

It will be helpful if someone can show you the rope. No one person can answer all the questions. That’s why you need a board of mentors. I’ve learned so much from the people around me, my mentors, colleagues, friends and online.

Having a higher goal than just finding a job will help you sail through ups and downs.

**TO LEARN: stick with it, sticky fingers, stick in your mind** 

Hi , In DDM 547 my students ran into the word “stick” twice.“sticky-fingers George"

- We’re gonna stick with the calzones (*a type of food*).
- When I find something I like, I stick with it.

 Stick is one of those words that has DOZENS of definitions and is used MANY times each day. It’s a word that you NEED to master if you want to be good at daily English.Like I always say to students at the intermediate and advanced level: In order to improve your daily English—STOP memorizing and start using. “using” includes **listening** to English (podcasts, radio, music) and **watching** English (TV, movies, etc.)!

So, let’s go back to STICK.

I’m guessing that these two are easy for most of you:

- “We’re gonna stick with the calzones (*a type of food*).”
- “When I find something I like, I stick with it.”

They mean: you will NOT change.

- You will continue to eat calzones.
- Once you find something you like, you’ll continue to eat (*any verb*) it.

But what about the first one?

1. “sticky-fingers George”

That means that George likes to STEAL things! It’s an idiom and the image of it is funny! Imagine you have “honey” on your fingers…then whenever you touch something, it sticks (attaches/adheres) to your fingers! Do you know anyone with sticky fingers? My cat Minty has sticky fingers!! She loves to steal my pen caps~ But people with sticky fingers…they might be stealing your money!



After you learn new expressions like theseà

MAKE your own sentences!

LOOK for other examples online!

If you do that, those new expressions will STICK IN YOUR MIND!! You won’t forget them!

 

Perhaps you should inquire: 

pay attention to your vowel sound : e

succulent : Succulent food, especially meat or vegetables, is juicy and good to eat. 

supreme court :

abduct

communist

- zodiac: the “belt” of stars we see on the “ecliptic”. The ecliptic is path of the sun as the Earth orbits it. The belt is broken into 12 parts which each have a major constellation. Those constellations make up the zodiac.

- constellation: A constellation is a group of stars which form a pattern and have a name.

- Zinger: surprising or shocking news/information. When Shane said he was  married— that was a real zinger!

- Starstruck: to be in awe/shock/admiration of (usually) a celebrity! When you see a movie star and you are so surprised you can say anything

- what's the latest buzz? what's the latest news? 

- cosmos

- Zodiac signs:the 12 constellations that are seen along the ecliptic 

- To sort it all out: to clear

  up the confusion, to set us straight, to explain it to us

- A shakeup: a reorganization. Every time a new president begins work, there’s a shakeup in top management

- Buzzing about: talking about

- Planetarium: a room with a rounded ceiling on which projections of the solar system are displayed. It allows the study of the stars and planets as they move in unison.

- Astrologers: people who “predict the future” by considering your birthdate and time and comparing it with the alignment of the stars and planets

- Orbit: the curved path a planet takes as it goes aroundits sun...satellites and comets, too!

- comet: A comet is a bright object with a long tail that travels around the sun. 
  Halley's Comet is going to come back in 2061. 

- Aligned to the starts: lined up with the stars, in synch with the stars

- Babylonians: the people from the ancient civilization of Babylon

- A bit off: not quite accurate

- Word is...: some people are saying

- Constellations: permanent groups of stars that make up the zodiac

- Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn

before you start reading a new horoscope, word is there are actually two different zodiac calendars. Most Westerners follow the tropical zodiac based on seasons instead of constellations, and nothing has changed there.

- horoscope : a description of what is going to happen to sb in the future, based on the position of the stars and the planets when the person was born

LME 20 http://archive.aweber.com/ddm_membership/M2Qr3/h/Lesson_20_Know_the.htm

From about 7:30am until 8 or 9pm, you’ll find me at my desk. In front of two computers, four monitors, two cameras and microphones. My desk is where nearly ALL of my work gets done.

I’m sure you are the same. **Sitting at our desks is how most of us earn a living.** I don’t mind that…but I think my **butt** is getting bigger!!

Today I want to talk a little about “furniture”. Specifically, the difference between **desks** and **tables**.

My wife’s desk is *actually* a kitchen table. She uses that because she wants a huge area to work on. My desk is a regular **L-shaped desk**. My son has a desk, too…or is it a table?

What’s the general difference?

Desks are for WORKING and STUDYING! And they usually have a drawer, but not always.

Tables are for EATING or for MEETINGS with several people. Most of you have a table in your kitchen or dining room.

My desk has a drawer. It also has **two electricity outlets** (where you can plug in an electronic device) and it**’s cable-friendly** (there are holes in the frame and top of the desk to **run computer cables through**).

My wife’s desk has NO drawer. Like I told you, it was sold as a kitchen table. But she has a huge area to work on. I’m a bit jealous!

Mikey’s desk…I call it a desk because I’ll want him to eventually color and read and write there. But it has no drawer! But I won’t want him to eat there, so I’m not going to call it a table! It’s very sturdy…so I guess that one day it’ll become a ***footstool***!!

As you can see, **tables can be both**—a table or a desk. But **desks are only desks**!

These days, **standing desks** are very popular. What do you think? Would you like to have one? I think I would like one!!

And if you have a sofa in your living room, you might have a COFFEE TABLE! Those are perfect for coffee, magazines and remote controls.

So, what’s on your coffee table? Your desk? Your kitchen table? Send a picture, maybe we’ll include it in an **upcoming Tuesday’s English Magazine!**



Technology: Distracting, Disturbing, Deceiving, & Deluding Ourselves To Death

 https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-01-28/technology-distracting-disturbing-deceiving-deluding-ourselves-death?from=singlemessage&isappinstalled=0

- Delude: If you delude yourself, you let yourself believe that something is true, even though it is not true. 

[*Authored by Jim Quinn via The Burning Platform blog,*](https://www.theburningplatform.com/2019/01/27/technology-distracting-disturbing-deceiving-deluding-ourselves-to-death/)

> *“What Huxley teaches is that in the age of advanced technology, spiritual devastation is more likely to come from an enemy with a smiling face than from one whose countenance exudes suspicion and hate. In the Huxleyan prophecy, Big Brother does not watch us, by his choice. We watch him, by ours. There is no need for wardens or gates or Ministries of Truth.*
>
> *When a population becomes distracted by trivia, when cultural life is redefined as a perpetual round of entertainments, when serious public conversation becomes a form of baby-talk, when, in short, a people become an audience and their public business a vaudeville act, then a nation finds itself at risk; a culture-death is a clear possibility.”* ― **Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business**

- Vaudeville: vaudeville is a type of entertainment consisting of short acts such as comedy, singing, and dancing. Vaudeville was especially popular in the early part of the twentieth century. (mainly AM; in BRIT usually use music hall) 

**Something as mundane as using the restroom at work sometimes ends up triggering deeper thoughts about technology – its benefits, deficiencies and danger to our culture.** I’ve been using the same restroom at work for the last twelve years. They remodeled the restroom a few years ago with the latest technology – automatic flushers, automatic soap dispensers, automatic spigots, and automatic towel dispenser. This technology is supposed to make things better, but from my perspective the technology just added complexity, glitches and unnecessary complications.

- mundane : Something that is mundane is very ordinary and not at all interesting or unusual. 
  Be willing to do mundane tasks with good grace. 
  ...the mundane realities of life. 
  ADJ-GRADED 
  = boring 
- spigot: A spigot is a faucet or tap
- glitch: A glitch is a problem which stops something from working properly or being successful. (INFORMAL) 

First off, these technological “improvements” did not eliminate any humans from the equation. The housekeepers responsible for the restrooms continued to be employed. Prior to the remodel they would fill a metal bin with individual paper towels and fill the soap dispenser with liquid soap. Now they have to insert a roll of paper towels in the electronic dispenser and a cartridge of soap in the electronic soap dispenser.

- A cartridge is part of a machine or device that can be easily removed and replaced when it is worn out or empty. 
  Change the filter cartridge as often as instructed by the manufacture. 

Instead of doing this daily, they wait until they are empty before replacing the towels and soap. That means they run out during the day. It must be dozens off times when I’ve washed my hands and put my hands in front of the automatic towel machine and nothing comes out. Then your choice is going to a stall and using toilet paper or wiping your hands on your pants. When it’s not empty, **it jams 20% of the time.** The automatic faucets stay on too long or go off by themselves with no one near them.

The bottom line is this bathroom technology was costly, requires ongoing costs for battery replacement, did not eliminate any labor costs, malfunctions at a far greater rate than the previous manual devices, and provides less service and satisfaction than the non-technological methods.

This led me to ponder whether this microcosm of technological dysfunction and dissatisfaction applies to technology on a much larger scale, as technology has been sold to the masses as the solution to all of our ills and a sure sign we are progressing as a civilization and culture. Technological advances have given the masses the false impression their lives have gotten better, when in reality the technology has enslaved and controlled them while providing a never-ending distraction from reality, critical thinking and the truth.

> *“Americans no longer talk to each other, they entertain each other. They do not exchange ideas, they exchange images. They do not argue with propositions; they argue with good looks, celebrities and commercials.”* ― **Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business**

With virtually everyone in America having access to the internet, smart phones containing more computing power than NASA used to launch rocket ships into outer space, and the proliferation of computers even in the poorest school districts, the masses should be far more intelligent and informed than previous generations. But nothing could be further from the truth.

**Technology is wasted on people who haven’t been taught to think critically, have been indoctrinated by government run schools to be subservient cogs in the machine, and believe feelings and emotions are more important than knowledge and understanding.** The proliferation of social media (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram) has resulted in the dumbing down of human interactions and replacement of discussing issues with virtue signaling, selfies, faux manufactured outrage, and glorifying shallow celebrities. We’re addicted to technology.

**It is incomprehensible our society has embraced technology for amusement, trivialities, and superficial displays of diversion, rather than advancement of knowledge, proliferation of ideas, and cultural progress and enrichment.** The works of Aristotle, Socrates, Shakespeare, Dickens, Twain, Tolstoy, Steinbeck, Orwell and Huxley are available with one click of your iGadget, but instead the masses choose to play Angry Birds, Candy Crush, and Madden, while worshipping at the altar of Kardashian. So much knowledge and wisdom at your fingertips, guaranteed to make you smarter and 99.9% choose to amuse themselves into a stupor of ignorance.

Are we just a society of intellectual lightweights, driven by emotions and sensitivities? Or is this infinite infantilism designed and implemented by those controlling the culture through their ownership of all media platforms? It appears to be a purposeful deliberate strategy implemented by the ruling class to dumb down the masses through the public education (indoctrination) system, divert their attention and thoughts through modern day electronic bread and circuses, enslaving them in debt, and pillaging global wealth and power through control of the political, financial, and mass media structures. And now they utilize the technology to spy on you and make sure you are not contradicting the establishment narrative.

> *“Our politics, religion, news, athletics, education and commerce have been transformed into congenial adjuncts of show business, largely without protest or even much popular notice. The result is that we are a people on the verge of amusing ourselves to death.”* **― Neil Postman**

If the daily machinations, intrigues, schemes, and plot twists broadcast 24/7 seem like an orchestrated reality TV show, it’s because they are. It’s nothing more than an enhanced Truman Show where we are all Truman. The controllers produce the daily disinformation propaganda; superficial story-lines designed to play upon your emotions; plot twists designed to invoke hope, despair, anger, fear, and desire; and a ceaseless mantra that the government, mega-corporations, Wall Street bankers, and chosen “experts” know what is best for us.

**They don’t want a citizenry who understands what is going on, how to think critically and question the establishment, or live within their means. They want obedient consumers** who believe what they are told by “authorities” and are just smart enough to follow the rules laid down by their superiors. A nation built on illusions, delusions, disinformation and confusion.

> *“Television is altering the meaning of ‘being informed’ by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation. Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information – misplaced, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information – information that creates the illusion of knowing something, but which in fact leads one away from knowing.”* **― Neil Postman**

**Television has always been an effective tool in keeping the masses under control.** Talking media heads, sold to the public as highly intelligent and educated journalists, mouthed their lines, written by invisible men working on behalf of the wealthy ruling class, to sooth the savage beasts known as the masses. Control the message and you control society.

**With the advent of the internet, what should have been a vast awakening and enlightenment of the masses, has just been a degradation to the lowest common denominator.** Social media platforms have eliminated thought, conversation, seriousness, knowledge, intelligence, and clarity from the public square and replaced it with narcissism, vitriol, virtue signaling, triviality, attacking anyone with a different viewpoint, and self-promotion.

Now that the Silicon Valley social media behemoth corporations have hundreds of millions addicted to amusing themselves to death, they can decide what is acceptable speech and that which doesn’t conform to their left-wing views. Censorship, public shaming, manufactured outrage and destroying those with an alternative point of view is now in the control of a small cabal of extremely rich men.

They use contrived incidents like the Covington High School kids “threatening” a “noble” Vietnam Vet Native American in a blatant attempt to spin their web of deceit. **Their technological control over public discourse is a threat to our freedom of speech and to our society.** Anyone who thinks for themselves is in danger of becoming an outcast and/or cyber criminal in our new dystopian existence.

> *“For in the end, he was trying to tell us what afflicted the people in ‘Brave New World’ was not that they were laughing instead of thinking, but that they did not know what they were laughing about and why they had stopped thinking.”* **― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business**

Neil Postman published his book in 1985, one year after the title of Orwell’s chilling view of a dark and brutal dystopian future. Postman’s view at the time was Huxley’s Brave New World dystopia had proven to be the more accurate assessment of the future. And he was probably right thirty-four years ago. He accurately assessed how the masses had been trained like Pavlov’s dogs to follow their emotions rather than their intellects.

**The average person actually thinks they are informed, when they have been programmed by disinformation peddled by the corporate media at the behest of their oligarch masters. Ignorance is not strength. War is not peace. Freedom is not slavery.**

The misleading information – superficial, irrelevant, fake news – is designed to create the illusion of knowledge when, in reality, it leads you away from knowledge. Postman didn’t think the dumbing down of Americans was deliberate. He attributed it to TV entertaining rather than informing.

I believe those in control of the levers of society have made a calculated effort to convince the masses their willful ignorance is actually knowledge. The ignorant are much easier to manipulate and lead down any path necessary to benefit those in charge. Accumulating wealth and power is much easier when the masses can’t think, understand basic mathematical truths, or comprehend reality.

**Postman compared the two dystopian visions at the outset of his brilliant tome:**

> *“We were keeping our eye on 1984. When the year came and the prophecy didn’t, thoughtful Americans sang softly in praise of themselves. The roots of liberal democracy had held. Wherever else the terror had happened, we, at least, had not been visited by Orwellian nightmares.*
>
> *But we had forgotten that alongside Orwell’s dark vision, there was another – slightly older, slightly less well known, equally chilling: Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World. Contrary to common belief even among the educated, Huxley and Orwell did not prophesy the same thing. Orwell warns that we will be overcome by an externally imposed oppression. But in Huxley’s vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy, maturity and history. As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think.*
>
> *What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy.*
>
> *As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny “failed to take into account man’s almost infinite appetite for distractions.” In 1984, Orwell added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we fear will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we desire will ruin us.*
>
> *This book is about the possibility that Huxley, not Orwell, was right.”* **― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business**



**Postman was most certainly correct in his assessment of our society in 1985.** TV was still the overwhelming method of information and entertainment for the average person. People still had newspapers and magazines delivered to their homes. Cable news had just launched. The internet was not in widespread use. Home computers were in their infancy. Cell phones for every person was a distant dream.

**Orwell’s dark future had not materialized, YET. Huxley’s subtler dystopia required far fewer authoritarian measures.** The unseen psychological manipulation of the masses, as described and practiced by Edward Bernays and his sycophants, was far more effective in molding minds, designing the culture, and forming the ideas of the masses without them realizing they were nothing but lab rats in a grand experiment. Propaganda works.

**Since 1985 the technological control over the masses has deepened and overwhelmed any resistance to its creeping governance of our daily lives.** The proliferation of computers, 24-hour cable TV and “smart” phones for the masses has given the unseen manipulators of the public mind, known as the invisible government, the ultimate tools for engineering our minds and deciding what will be perceived as the central beliefs guiding our daily lives.

We have come to love our oppression and learned ignorance, adoring the very technologies enslaving us in trivialities, disinformation, shallow displays of virtue signaling, and eliminating our capacity to think. The masses have passively acquiesced to their oppressors by allowing technology to completely control their lives and form their opinions.

**The corporate mass media, through social media platforms, the internet, and TV overwhelm the masses with useless information designed to distract and divert our attention from the subversive actions of the wealthy oligarchs pulling the strings behind the technological curtain. The truth has been and continues to be hidden behind an avalanche of irrelevant minutiae and nonsense, spewing from our Screens.**

The purposeful purveyors of this garbage into the minds of the masses play to the lowest common denominator by producing disinformation designed to amuse, provoke fear, confuse, inflame desires, and kindle emotions. They most certainly don’t want citizens thinking critically, questioning the status quo, ignoring their dictates, discussing the real issues and problem confronting the country, or generating ideas which could undermine their control and potentially reduce their vast riches.

I think Portman was being somewhat naïve in thinking the dumbing down of society through technological means and government-controlled indoctrination public schools was an accident. As seen in both novels, the controllers knew exactly what they were doing and why they were doing it. The Brave New World method of control has worked for decades, but the propagation of websites appealing to critical thinkers and those questioning the approved narrative has endangered this command and control structure of the Deep State.

**That is why our society is now devolving towards Orwell’s vision of the future.** Battle lines began to be drawn when Snowden, Assange and other selfless patriots of freedom revealed the level of deception, disinformation, and criminality of the state and those supporting the state. Technology is now becoming the boot stomping on our faces forever.

**The tyranny being inflicted upon the masses by the likes of Google, Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, and other tech behemoths on behalf of their Deep State benefactors is chilling in its depth and depravity.** The oppression from the current day Big Brothers through censorship, banning of truth tellers, demonetization of those who don’t conform, and public shaming of dissenters has replaced the soft tyranny of mental manipulation.

The establishment now openly suppresses the truth through their control of all mainstream media channels and outlets. The alternate media is scorned and ridiculed as conspiracy theorists, nutjobs, and Russian collaborators. The level of fake news vomited by Deep State propagandists has reached a new level of hysteria. Dissenting viewpoints are crushed through economic penalties inflicted upon those who dare go against the approved doctrine of the state.

The use of technology to control the minds of the masses has produced unintended consequences which threatens the power of the Party. **A true Surveillance State, more comprehensive than Orwell ever conceived, is operating in full view.** Trying to lock down the internet has proven to be difficult for the ruling class as more and more critical thinking, pissed off citizens congregate on truth telling websites and stir discontent among the awakening masses.

The election of Trump seems to have been a lightning rod for the discontent to bubble to the surface. There is an all-out technological war being waged between the corporate oppressors and those they are trying to control. The current escalation will surely lead to all out violent war in the foreseeable future.

Huxley’s soft tyranny, where we have been conditioned to obey and never consider revolution, is being replaced by Orwell’s vicious tyranny where persecution, torture and power will be on full display as this revolution begins in earnest. Portman was just early in his conclusion. **Huxley and Orwell were both right. The Party doesn’t care about us. They just use us to attain their own felonious needs. We need to break free from the chains enslaving our minds and take back our country by force.** Time is growing short. Will we meekly accept the fate of Winston Smith and John the Savage inflicted by the State or will we rise up against the technological tyranny oppressing our freedoms and liberties? The answer will decide our fate.

> “Now I will tell you the answer to my question. It is this. The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power, pure power.
>
> We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power. Now you begin to understand me.” – **George Orwell, 1984**
>
> "One believes things because one has been conditioned to believe them. Most men and women will grow up to love their servitude and will never dream of revolution.” – **Aldous Huxley, Brave New World**

*The corrupt establishment will do anything to suppress sites like the Burning Platform from revealing the truth. The corporate media does this by demonetizing sites like mine by blackballing the site from advertising revenue. If you get value from this site, please keep it running with a donation.*

Time flies. It's the end of January!  IF you made "new year" plans BUT have not had a good start...

No problem! A new month is always a good time to start  AND 

The Lunar New Year (Chinese New Year) will start on February 5th--one week from today!!

 Remember, "later is better than never". 

 **Quit delaying** and just start that thing you were thinking of doing! 

Another thing people say, "if you want something to get finished, give it to a busy person". That means, "busy people get more things done."

So, if you think you're TOO BUSY to start or do something new...maybe it's actually the perfect time!

A rally in Berlin (no animal farms, no glyphosate, no GM-food, no big corporations owning land and so on..

- rally:  A gathering, especially one intended to inspire enthusiasm for a cause

- glyphosate /ɡlaɪˈfɑset/
- GM - genetically modified - food

We had an email exchange regarding some of these photos. I think it's important that we participate in events that will make our world a better place. 

And can you think of a better place than your PLATE? We have so many different things to eat, but too many people are choosing things that are EASY but not necessarily HEALTHY or CLEAN.

I'm not a fan of big government--but rallying people together to share ideas: that's always a good thing.

Hello, coach Shane!

I am Svetlana, from Russia. Thank you very much for your lessons. They are very useful. I love your lessons. 

 In the pictures, a cake that I made myself. But I'm still learning :) The second  photo shows Christmas treats. And the next photo below shows French macaroons. They're delicious! :)

I would say that you are **doing a great job learning how to** make and decorate these delicious treats! And this is a great way to "learn some" English, too!

 **Keep up the excellent work** and please continue to share more pictures of your baking achievements!!

Those are really well-kept antiques! You take many pictures of these old cinema gadgets. I'm wondering, do you ever purchase any? Are you planning a museum of your own? Do you know how to operate any of them? **Keep us informed, please!!** 

- antique: An antique (Latin:antiquus; "old", "ancient") is an old collectable item. It is collected or desirable because of its age, beauty, rarity, condition, utility, personal emotional connection, and/or other unique features. It is an object that represents a previous era or time period in human society.

A little update from me. Last Saturday, the Russian Orthodox Church celebrated Epiphany. So I took several pics at our local monastery. Many people took the plunge into an ice-hole as a part of the Epiphany celebration. 

- Epiphany: Epiphany is a Christian festival on the 6th of January which celebrates the arrival of the wise men who came to see Jesus Christ soon after he was born. 
- monastery: a house for persons under religious vows especially : an establishment for monks
- take the plunge : to do or undertake something decisively especially after a period of hesitation or uncertainty

UGH!! Polar bears!! How can they stand there so casually? I would love to do that in the winter IF the water were actually **a hot spring**!!

And it looks as though you did not participate in the plunge. Good. Stay healthy!

Is that **giraffe** made from snow???!!!

The monastery looks great in the snow! Really nice pictures. I'm sure you all had a wonderful celebration! Thanks as always, Andrey!

Hi, CS! How are you doing?

I'm sending you **shots of some of the New Year decorations** at my office and outside near my job. 

Hi Coach Shane,

**Just if you're curious:**

From the ugly chrysalis the butterfly called Papilio Rumanzovia came out. Kamila named her Ladybug. She lives 7-10 days. Now is her 7th day with us.

- A chrysalis is a butterfly or moth in the stage between being a larva and an adult. 

The small orange butterfly called Biblis, she lived with us 16 days, when normally they live only 14 days. She's a granny butterfly. We respect her with the whole family). 

BTW Morpho is still with us, and this is her 12th day. But they say they live 3-4 months, honestly I don't think that she'll live so long with us. But we'll see...

Kamila is doing an excellent job raising these butterflies!! It must be a very good experience for her. And...sorry...**it's actually a great way for a child to learn about LIFE and DEATH**.

Got snow... We **got hit with two pretty big snowfalls in just over a week**. LOTS of **shoveling and plowing**. I still have one deck to go. Anyone want to help? It's the deck on the side of the house where I have my barbecue grill. It is FULL of snow. I'll send a picture probably next week.

Ugh...very pretty but very heavy! 

Making my coffee. What sort of ingredients do you ADD to your coffee? Do you only drink it black? Let me know! If enough people share their secret coffee recipes, maybe I'll share mine!!

**Brrr. (That's what we write when we want to say IT IS COLD!!)** 

We feed the birds and deer. The deer get fed in the evening in those three big feed buckets. But in the afternoon, I add some sunflower seeds for the birds. The temperature was -35 at 2 in the afternoon.

Tomorrow will be just as cold!!! IT IS FREEZING OUTSIDE!! Perfect weather for staying INSIDE and reading, studying, watching a movie!!

- scheme: A scheme is someone's plan for achieving something. 
  ...a quick money-making scheme to get us through the summer... 
  They would first have to work out some scheme for getting the treasure out. 
- paradigm: A paradigm is a model for something which explains it or shows how it can be produced. (FORMAL)

LME 22 http://archive.aweber.com/ddm_membership/MfFh3/h/Lesson_22_How_MUCH_do_you.htm

Are you a movie buff or a movie lover or a cinephile?!

-   buff: You use buff to describe someone who knows a lot about a particular subject. For example, if you describe someone as a film buff, you mean that they know a lot about films. (INFORMAL) 
    Judge Lanier is a real film buff. 
    Any competent computer buff should be able to do it for you in a few minutes. 
    N-COUNT: supp N 
    = enthusiast
- cinephile: A film or movie enthusiast.

Well, they’re all BASICALLY the same. However…if you ask someone who calls themself a cinephile…they might tell you they’re different!

So, let’s TRY and see if we can differentiate the three!

Movie lovers: they LOVE movies! Usually popular, mainstream movies. They often go to the latest movies, watch movies on TV and buy DVDs or Bluerays. They can tell you WHO starred in WHAT! Movies are a **hobby**

Movie buffs: they are a bit more serious. They usually watch a wider range of movies…often they’ll watch ANYTHING. They like to really know who starred in what, who the director was, when it was made, etc. These guys, compared to normal people, can be…different! Movies are an obsession.

Cinephiles: these are the wine-drinkers of movie-watching! They are VERY proud of watching movies that no one else has ever heard of. They like artsy, low-budget, non-Hollywood films. These people are also different! Harmless, but intense! Movies are a **religion**!

- artsy: Someone who is arty seems very interested in drama, film, music, poetry, or painting. People often describe someone as arty when they want to suggest that the person is pretentious. (INFORMAL) 
  Didn't you find her a little bit too arty? 
  ...an arty French film. 
  ADJ-GRADED 
  = artsy

Well…those are MY definitions of each. And I’m sure many people would want to disagree with me. BUT, I’m also sure that most people would actually agree!

LME 23  <http://archive.aweber.com/ddm_membership/Lp8W3/h/Lesson_23_Let_s_DRINK_.htm>



We might look different, we might speak different languages, we might believe in different things…but we do have ONE thing in common. We ALL eat and drink!!

Today I’m going to introduce a few DRINKING verbs that you can use when you're drinking ANYTHING: tea, milk, water, beer, whiskey, etc!

Since I’m a beer lover, I’ll use beer in my examples, okay?!

**Nursing** a beer…

If you are nursing a beer, you’re drinking it very slowly! I do this a lot—one beer can take over an hour! Sometimes two!!

**Sipping** a beer . This is similar to nursing, but if someone SIPS something, it’s usually because:

It’s very hot; It’s too cold; It’s too strong; It’s too bitter; It tastes bad!; It tastes VERY good!

**Swigging a beer**, When you are hot and thirsty, swigging your drink is exactly what you want to do! You lift it up and take several gulps (swallows). You might even drink the whole thing. ONE POINT to remember; we tend to swig things that are in bottles or cans, not glasses or cups.

**Chugging a beer**

Perfect for drinking an entire glass of beer! Or water…or Gatorade…or whatever! Again, you can imagine the sound you make while drinking~ “Glug, glug, glug, glug~”

- chug:  a dull explosive sound made by or as if by a laboring engine

**Slamming a beer**

This is what we do when we want to celebrate AND drink hard! You can slam milk…but it’s much more common to slam a beer or a shot of whiskey! You pick up the drink FAST and drink HARD and SLAM the drink back down on the table or bar!

-  slam: If you slam something down, you put it there quickly and with great force. 
    She listened in a mixture of shock and anger before slamming the phone down.

There are MANY more verbs you can use when you are drinking—but I think those five are the most FUN and the most COMMON!

**A quick recap:**

Below, as you go to the right, your drinking motion gets faster/harder...

**nursing** **->** **sipping****->**  **swigging****->** **chugging****->** **slamming**

2014 is here! I wish you and your family the best! I hope that you have set goals and made plans for the New Year. I have. My first goal is to quit smoking, my second goal is to compete in **sprint-triathlons**, and my third goal is to create more videos and podcasts for you than I did in 2013. I am confident that I can achieve my goals.

If one of your goals is to study English, stay with me! I promise much more free content in 2014! If you are really serious about English, then I ABSOLUTELY recommend investing in yourself and taking DDM classes.

 What will you get?  You will start MASTERING American English pronunciation. You will ABSOLUTELY improve your listening skills. Your English listening comprehension will ABSOLUTELY improve. You will ABSOLUTELY gain confidence in your English speaking skills. You will learn SO MUCH about American culture and the American lifestyle, history and perspective.

You will have SO many chances to talk with great DDM Family members from around the world! Most people use English, but many do use their native language to ask questions. You will, if you want, have LIVE classes with me. 

This is an investment in yourself. And compared to ANY other English course online, DDM is by far the BEST "all-around American English course". As you know, you start with listening, then writing, then vocabulary, then pronunciation, then comprehension, and then background information. In EVERY lesson. And you receive 8 lessons every month. DDM is a self-study course which means you can study whenever and wherever you want. Everything on one day OR over the weekends OR a little bit every day...whenever and wherever you want!

- The Real Resistance: Washington State Sheriffs Refuse To Enforce Unconstitutional Gun Laws<https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-01-29/real-resistance-washington-state-sheriffs-refuse-enforce-unconstitutional-gun-laws?from=singlemessage&isappinstalled=0>

This article points out the power that armed Americans hold as a final check against tyrannical government.  I lived in Washington state for 21 years and watched as many attempts were made to limit gun rights, but failed.  Now the left has won power and they intend to remain in control and to disarm the people.  It will not work.

- tyrannical: If you describe a government or organization as tyrannical, you mean that it 
  acts without considering the wishes of its people and treats them cruelly or 
  unfairly. 
  ...one of the world's most oppressive and tyrannical regimes. 
  ADJ-GRADED 

Long thought to be the last line of defense between authoritarianism and freedom, sheriffs are in a unique position. As elected officials, basically nobody has authority over them – not the judges, not the Feds – no one except the people who may or may not choose to re-elect them.

- sheriffs: an important official of a shire or county charged primarily with judicial duties (as executing the processes and orders of courts and judges)

**What are those new gun laws in Washington?**

In November, Washington voters passed a **ballot** initiative, I-1639. To purchase a semi-automatic rifle, buyers must be over 21, **undergo an enhanced background check**, must have completed a safety course, and need to wait 9 days to **take possession of** their weapon. And that’s not all. A gun owner who doesn’t store his or her weapon “properly” can be prosecuted.

And that was just the beginning of the **unconstitutional** momentum.

> **Feeling the wind at their backs after the ballot, gun campaigners and liberal legislators have now gone even further in the new legislative session**. Bills introduced in the last week to Washington’s Democrat-dominated legislature look to further restrict firearms. Some laws would ban high capacity magazines and plastic guns made with 3D printers. Others would mandate training for concealed carry permits, and remove guns and ammo during and after domestic violence incidents.
>
> Washington’s attorney general, Bob Ferguson, who proposed several of the bills, said in an email: “Now is the time to act. **Washingtonians** have made it clear that they support common-sense gun safety reforms.” ([source](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/26/washington-state-gun-laws-law-enforcement-rural?fbclid=IwAR301Jmy_3eqz-KyGBIBjlYyuDU4ukVItcb2r4j6yT00nIBOVOh-xcrIQXM))

- momentum: If a process or movement gains momentum, it keeps developing or happening more quickly and keeps becoming less likely to stop. 
  This campaign is really gaining momentum. 
  They are each anxious to maintain the momentum of the search for a solution. 
- wind at (one's) back
  A favorable position that encourages forward momentum (as with a ship that has the wind at its back). e.g. She really struggled in her studies last year, but she's had the wind at her back ever since changing her major.
- mandate: When someone is mandated to carry out a particular policy or task, they are given the official authority to do it. (FORMAL) 
  He'd been mandated by the West African Economic Community to go in and to enforce a ceasefire. 
  The elections are mandated by a peace accord signed by the government last May. 
  VB: usu passive 

Things are getting more and more difficult for gun owners in a state that has two very different demographics.

Washington is a reflection of the rest of the US.

The state of Washington is similar to the United States in general. The vast majority of the population lives in a few large cities, distant from the rural and small-town folks in a lot more than just mileage. **The left-leaning cities are in direct opposition to the more right-leaning rural communities**, but the rural communities are **under the thumb** of the city voters due to numbers.

- under the thumb: being controlled by sb. A term usually used to describe a person who is subservient in a relationship. 
  -see also "under the cosh"

Back when they voted on I-1639, [27 of the 39 counties were against the measure](https://results.vote.wa.gov/results/20181106/State-Measures-Initiative-Measure-No-1639-Initiative-Measure-No-1639-concerns-firearms_ByCounty.html), but because the twelve counties that voted FOR it were more populous, the initiative passed.

Does this sound familiar? If it weren’t for the electoral college in national elections, we’d probably have Hillary Clinton as our president, and she’s **notoriously** anti-gun. The situation of gun owners would look very different right now if that had happened.

Now the state is divided because the counties that voted against the measure are **refusing to be governed by unconstitutional laws to which they objected in the first place**

And they’re supported by their sheriffs.

*Some Washington law enforcement officers are refusing to enforce these laws.*

Klickitat County Sheriff, Bob Songer, Republic police chief Loren Culp, and Ferry County Sheriff Ray Maycumber are among those who have publicly vowed **not to enforce the new unconstitutional gun laws**.



Matt Marshall, the leader of the Washington Three Percent, is hoping to persuade other Washington counties to adopt **local second amendment sanctuary ordinances.** Next week, he meets with people in Lewis and Pierce counties to urge them to  adopt resolutions not to enforce unconstitutional gun laws.

This isn’t the first time that sheriffs have stood up against unreasonable laws.

As elected officials, sheriffs **have an obligation to their constituents and to the Constitution of the United States of America.**

In 2013, El Dorado County Sheriff John D’Agostini kicked the US Forestry Service out of his county.



This kind of action is firmly supported by the [10th Amendment to the Constitution, which reads](https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/United_States_of_America_1992), “The powers not **delegated** to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”

*The power of county sheriffs was upheld in the Supreme Court.*

In 1994, Graham County Arizona Sheriff Richard Mack and Ravalli County Montana Sheriff Jay Printz successfully **sued** the Clinton Administration **over** the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act.

Justice Antonin Scalia, Chief Justice William Rehnquist, and Justices Sandra Day O’Connor, Anthony Kennedy, and Clarence Thomas found that the Brady Act’s attempted **commandeering of** the sheriffs to perform background checks violated the tenth amendment.

- commandeer: to take arbitrary or forcible possession of

> 

The decision upheld the power of county sheriffs.

- uphold: If you uphold something such as a law, a principle, or a decision, you support and maintain it. 

*County sheriffs are the last legal line of defense.*

Legally speaking, our county sheriffs are the last line of defense in the battle for gun rights.

> Federal agencies do not have state powers. **Due to the Constitution’s structure of dual sovereignty**, the feds have no authority to enforce state laws. Furthermore, states cannot be compelled to enforce federal laws. ([source](https://blog.tenthamendmentcenter.com/2013/07/sheriffs-to-the-feds-you-are-on-notice/))

The next option is widespread civil disobedience, which we saw recently in New Jersey.

Try as anti-gun legislators and activists might, there is a difficult battle ahead for anyone who tries to disarm the American people. Between Constitution-supporting elected officials and American civilians who will not comply, the *real* Resistance seems to be ready…and armed.

LME <http://archive.aweber.com/ddm_membership/FP3Cp/h/Lesson_24_Phrasal_Verb.htm>

Phrasal Verb Friday!

Yes, that is NOW going to be a regular feature for Friday’s email! I might do phrasal verbs on other days, but for sure—#PhrasalVerbFriday!

As you know: In order to master DAILY ENGLISH, you need to master **FOUR things**;

1. Pronunciation
2. Pronouns
3. Phrasal Verbs
4. Get/Got

There is NO proper order—you need to master ALL of them.

Today, I’m going to combine #3 and #4.

 **Get + Preposition** is a VERY common phrasal verb pattern.

**Get + Preposition + Preposition** is also pretty common!

Here are a few common examples:

Quit playing games and **get over** to the dinner table. MOVE/GO

Don’t try to **get over on** me! MANIPULATE/LIE

Let’s **get** this project **over** **with**. FINISH

I will never **get over** her~ FORGET

To **get over** difficulties, you must keep moving. OVERCOME

It took me a week to **get over** my cold. RECOVER

You need to **get over** your pronunciation problems. MASTER

 You’ll remember that I told you:

In many situations, it’s possible to VISUALIZE the phrasal verb in the context. This is true in the above examples—and I can SHOW you these phrasal verbs in my lessons. If you’re a student, ask me in next week’s AMA (Ask Me Anything) class, okay?!

So, I’m going to give you five more GET + phrasal verbs. I want you to try and match the phrasal verb with the sentence! Good luck!! You’ll have to change the conjugation on two of them.

·       It’s Friday night! I’m ready to **get down**! Turn up the music~~ (*dance*)

·       It was so cold, I was amazed that my chickens were able to **get through** the -30 degree temperatures. (*stay alive*)

·       I **get along with** John, but I do NOT like his brother Jack. (*have a good relationship with*)

·       These days I’m **getting into** classical music. I used to hate it~ (*becoming interested in*)

·       It’s Saturday morning…I don’t want to **get up**~~ (*rise from sleep*)

·       Even though I work more than 60 hours a week, I’m just **getting by**. (*surviving financially*)

The BEST way to master PHRASAL VERBS:

LEARN them in real situations.

USE them in real situations.

ASK questions about them to a coach like me!

 

You can do that by joining our classes!

- fate
- imputation
- depreciation

Hi

It's the LAST week of August...is that good or bad? I'm very happy! September is the beginning of so many things in the US--school starts, American football starts, and fall (autumn) starts! September is such a great month. It is also the birth month of someone very special to me^^

But, August is important...especially August 27th--that my mom's birthday! I love you, mom!! Happy birthday!!!

So, did you have a chance to listen to our Let's Master English podcast 41, yet? This week's fantastic newsletter that Parmy made is down below. Just click on the picture and you can download the PDF!

We talked about a LOT of stuff in this podcast...but I will give you all something special:

The title of the news story is "Pinot No More". Do you understand why? It's actually a joke--a pun. There is an expensive type of wine called "Pinot Noir". It's difficult to make, that's why it is expensive. The pronunciation in America is like "pee-no no-are". Well, many **barrels** and bottles of Pinot Noir were destroyed in the earthquake...so there is "no more Pinot Noir".  "noir" and "no more" sound similar so I made the title "Pinot No More"!!! I thought I was the only genius who could think of such a brilliant title...but I discovered that 8 years ago, there was a New York Times newspaper article with the exact same title...oh, well!!!

Enjoy the newsletter, enjoy the week!

Your English coach,

Shane

LME 25 <http://archive.aweber.com/ddm_membership/FZAMp/h/Lesson_25_Americana_Monday_.htm>

So last Friday we started "Phrasal Verb Friday". **Huge success!**Thank you for all the emails. What about Mondays... How about "Americana Monday". We'll learn about America (USA) and American culture and American history. Hmm...that MIGHT sound boring to some of you, but let's see if I can make it interesting.

**REMEMBER**: Learning a language is MORE than just grammar, vocabulary and pronunciation. It's deeper than that!! Let's try!

In our recent DDM assignment, we learned about the **tip jar**.

In the US, you’ll see these jars in all kinds of businesses…

Convenience stores…Coffee shops…Take-out restaurants…Bakeries

And the question is: WHY do we need to tip them?!

In the USA, there are a few times when you ABSOLUTELY should be tipping:

In the case of a waiter at a restaurant or a server at a bar, tipping IS considered “**common courtesy**”. It’s something we SHOULD do. And there’s a reason; *waiters and servers can legally be paid LESS than \**minimum wage***—a LOT less. Minimum wage is the LOWEST you can pay an employee—different states have different amounts. People take those VERY low paying jobs because of the tips.

- common courtesy:  Courtesy is politeness, respect, and consideration for others. (FORMAL) 
  ...a gentleman who behaves with the utmost courtesy towards ladies... 
  He did not even have the courtesy to reply to my fax. 

**Movers**. Those guys are working HARD! As long as they don’t break anything or lose anything, they should get a nice tip!

**Hairdressers**. Well, I go to a barber and I’ve never tipped. But my wife tells me that you MUST tip if you go to a hair salon~

**Room cleaning service at a hotel or motel**. A nice tip encourages them to keep those rooms clean. If you’re a messy person, give them a very nice tip!

**Food delivery guys**! They’re driving fast to deliver your food fresh! Many times at night and in bad weather. Tip them nicely!

There are MORE examples!!! But tip jars at other businesses?! Well, don’t get too worried. The typical tip would just be change. The coins you receive after paying.
Let’s say I bought something and the cost was $4.69. I give the guy 5 dollars. He gives me 31¢ in change. I think to myself: the cashier is polite, everyone at the store is always nice, the store is clean… 
Hey! Go ahead and keep the 31¢ in change!  

Boom, I put the change in the jar! Tip jars are usually SHARED among all the employees. The money might go for a party or for lunch~ Sometimes it goes to the **“Employee of the Week”** (the best worker of the week)! But if you REALLY don’t want to tip your **barista**…just use a credit card! 

- barista: Pretentious sounding word used by dejected art history and drama majors that describes their employment in order to make themselves feel better about serving coffee. <https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=barista>

A quick recap: tip jar, common courtesy, minimum wage, change, Employee of the Weekcommon courtesy:  Courtesy is politeness, respect, and consideration for others. (FORMAL) 
...a gentleman who behaves with the utmost courtesy towards ladies... 
He did not even have the courtesy to reply to my fax. 



### 2/6/2019

LEM 27 <http://archive.aweber.com/ddm_membership/MNeOp/h/Lesson_27_Sad_news_but.htm>

**TO LEARN: my condolences, I’m so sorry for your loss, my heart is with you, my thoughts are with you, my thoughts and prayers are with you and your family**

- Condolence: A message of condolence is a message in which you express your sympathy for someone because one of their friends or relatives has died recently. 
  Neil sent him a letter of condolence. 

Hi ,

For the next week…I may miss a few email lessons, but I’ll try my best. My mother passed away this morning—she’s not with us here on Earth, but I know she is looking down on our family and reassuring us that she is here and she is happy.

- reassure:  ~ sb (about sth)=  to say or do sth that makes sb less frightened or worried: [VN] They tried to reassure her, but she still felt anxious. ◆ [VN that] The doctor reassured him that there was nothing seriously wrong.

My mother suffered a great deal for a few months, but her last few weeks were much less painful. She passed in her sleep.

**My dad has been her ROCK for over 50 years. And he’ll continue to protect her memory and her honor.**

I’m grateful to have wonderful memories—memories that will last forever. And I promise that **I will continue to think of her and share our family’s milestones with her for as long as I live.**

It’s a very sad day for my family. Every family deals with this…what can we say?

My recommendation: Keep it simple. Try the following:

**My sincere condolences to you and your family.** (formal, polite)

**I’m so sorry for your loss.** (less formal, good for someone you know but is not a close friend.)

**My heart is with you.** (good for a friend)

**My thoughts are with you.** (good for anyone)

**My thoughts and prayers are with you and your family.** (good for a family who has religion)

Again, I’ll do my best for the next week or so. I’ll be driving to Nevada to be with my dad. Lots of driving and down time. We’ll see.

But I assure you, I’ll be back. And our Year of English will continue.

Have a wonderful day 😊 Don’t forget to tell someone you love that you love them!

Xmas? Christmas--the short version! DO NOT READ "ex mas"!! Read "Christmas"!!


Christmas is ONE week away! 

Christmas has many meanings...different meanings to different people.

ONE of those: a time to give gifts!

We have a few expressions that you might like:

- It's the thought that counts!

We use that expression when we receive a gift that we actually do NOT like!!

- It's better to give than to receive!

We use that expression when we give someone a gift but that person does NOT give us a gift!


BOTH of those expressions are true, don't you agree?! I LOVE receiving gifts...but as a person gets older, we actually want fewer things. And the things we want, usually, they are VERY expensive!

A new computer. A new TV. A new car!! But giving gifts...that is REALLY the best! 

Seeing the person's face "light up" with happiness! And when you get the person the perfect gift...it's GREAT!

This year, 2018, my wife gave me the greatest gift in the world. A son! Mikey!! How can I do better than her? Well, I don't think I can. But I'll try to be a good husband and a good father.

 Finding that perfect gift is sometimes REALLY difficult. Especially when the person is like me and says,
"Oh, I don't need anything for Christmas~!!"

But you know you MUST buy something!!

Well, I'm not going to give you a list of possible gifts to buy for people...except for ONE.

Give the gift of education! IF the person is interested in learning English like you are, study together! 

You are giving the gift of education AND companionship! You will be encouraging each other to improve!
And you will both be MASTERING English!!



- Hi! Coach Shane  I'm also a big fan of December.  I like Christmas so much . I like the atmosphere of the Christmas season. I will buy something to decorate my house. Oh! **The cute Christmas stuff really takes me away!** I  enjoy having strawberry cake around this time of the year. This cake is delicious. I really like the month of December !ヽ(✿ﾟ▽ﾟ)ノ

- Here are a few pictures of a hike

I completed a few weeks ago. It was at "Volcan Baru" in Panama. It was a  3,475-meter-high hike. It was a great experience, one of those that changes your outlook on life.  It was definitely one of 2018's greatest hits! 

WOW!!! That is **a MASSIVE climb**! But you called it a hike?! You're a SUPERMAN!! And the pictures are stunning! I'm really glad you shared this hike with us and I hope you share MORE of your life with us!! Not only with your regular students, but with our future students, too!! Merry Christmas, Clive!

- I made this cheesecake for me and my dear friends to celebrate several goals that were achieved these days. I received an important fitness certification which is really important for my career and other course credits, too.

I work in a kindergarten one day a week. I teach them **Pilates** and also English songs about the body and movements. You can see a Christmas tree that I made with them.  Happy Christmas and happy holidays to you and your family.



Hi Graziella!  I am SUPER proud of you!! Not only are you taking care of yourself physically, you are continuously learning and upgrading yourself. NOT just for yourself, but for others who want to be more physically fit. AND not just for adults, but you're helping kids see the value in exercise. And NOT just exercise, but English.  Wow!! SUPER work, Graziella! And **I wish you and your family the MERRIEST of CHRISTMASES!**



- This is my attempt at something a la Maroccan Tajine. Came out pretty good!!!! One notable missing ingredient was **pickled lemons**, but I’m already pickling some in the jar pictured. That’s the first of my two current projects. 

Aaand THIS is the second project. **An exclusive sneak peak into** the English grammar book I’m working on. I know all of you can tell time but I’m sure not everybody in the world can!! More to come in the near future ^^



Greetings, Coach Matt! I LOVE to hear your updates! The food looks...good! Pickled lemons? Hmm... Let us know how they turn out, okay? And describe the taste of your **delicious cuisine**...I'm curious! Your grammar book is going to be HUGE! I can't wait to see it. I hope you give me the honor of editing it...am I asking too much?! I wish you and Luka an absolutely wonderful Christmas! Did you prepare any gifts? Do you think Santa will deliver any to you? Merry Christmas, Coach! 



- Sending you some pictures of winter in Moscow! Take care you all!!

 Hi Gulya, The **Trubnikovs** are enjoying winter EXACTLY how it should be enjoyed! Outside and in the snow!!

 What about hot chocolate? Keep sending pictures and MERRY CHRISTMAS

- Let's get baking! Christmas in the US is a BIG cookie season. **Gingerbread men, snowballs and peanut butter blossoms.** Send pictures of your Christmas cookies.

  We made the gingerbread men  **a little chocolatey** this year. Still nice and spicy though! 


Delivering Christmas cookies. 

Giving. A gift. EVERYONE loves to get Christmas cookies! Especially a week or two BEFORE Christmas!! Oh...I'm going to get fat... I've already got a special plan for 2019. A plan to help me LOSE some weight. More on that later!!

Who will you pick to join with you?!!

- A climate rally in Berlin.

- Wow--you are taking pictures as a protester or as part of the media?! They're very good pictures. And the topic is very serious.

  Whether or not people believe in man-made climate change--I think we can all agree; we need to TAKE CARE of our environment. We need to NOT be wasteful. We shouldn't pollute. We should conserve. We should respect nature and replenish when we can. It all starts with YOU! Let's do OUR part!

  - Replenish  sth (with sth) (formal) to make sth full again by replacing what has been used: to replenish food and water supplies ◆ Allow me to replenish your glass.
    replenishment noun [U]: Computerization has enabled the automatic replenishment of stock.

- Hi Coach! You asked us, where do we study? As for me: I'm always practicing indoors in quiet places. Usually at home.  Live classes too, but sometimes, especially during vacation - in the forest, on a street or in the countryside. It really depends. Down below are the most common places:

At my daughter's room with her guinea pig. She loves that! (The guinea pig of course, not my daughter;)Every time I practice out loud, she perks up, starts running around, squeaks, then lies down and stares at me. Yet another place: the arm chair in the living room. More convenient, since I don't have to sit with my legs crossed all the time. 

This is my Live Classes Kingdom in the basement. It's way quieter down here and nobody whooshes around;) The only downside is that internet is not that good down here and sometimes I have to stand on the chair during the whole class to catch the wifi waves through the small window:) In the last picture, I was in AE class with Coach Clive.

Hi Darek, LOL!! Perhaps your daughter's guinea pig is from the US? But why doesn't your daughter like you practicing English...perhaps she is better than you?!

 Yes, the chair would be the best spot! But when you have too much activity nearby, it's hard to study.  Aha! I like your Live Classes Kingdom. You are the king down there...but the king needs a **wifi router or a signal booster**!! BE CAREFUL standing on chairs and speaking English. It can be a very dangerous combination!! Thanks for the great pictures and great humor, Darek! See you in class!!



I really liked your family members' photos. Your uncle and aunt look very intelligent. And I hope that medicine your dad takes will help him to overcome his cancer. I am sending some pics, I hope you find them funny! A **gypsy's** livestock **strolled** into our garden, I had to **shoo them away:)** Take care of you and your family!

 Hi Andrey, I LOVED the pictures!! I can guarantee you, if my neighbors livestock strolled into my yard or garden, I would be eating them! You were too kind^^



You remember I jumped my truck last week with the jumper cables? Well, it didn't work because the battery was COMPLETELY dead and the water in the battery actually froze and nearly burst the battery. So...I ended up getting a **tow truck** to pick up my truck. It's expensive but I need that truck to **plow the snow** and do other **chores** around the house. Ugh...

 Send in some photos of your Christmas trees! We finally decorated our tree and it's really beautiful! We have our own **family ornaments** that have a special meaning, but I also have a few ornaments from YOU! Students have sent me a few beautiful decorations that I will treasure forever!

**Homemade lasagna** tastes really good in the winter! And in the mornings? Homemade French toast with farm fresh maple syrup **is to die for**! Somebody told me that French toast is ACTUALLY German toast?!

This is the bread my wife made for the French toast. It's super soft and buttery and was perfect. It will also be really good for tuna or chicken salad sandwiches! What kind of bread do you use?

We had a few busy days so Mikey and I got hungry. At the local supermarket, they have a deli. Yum!! A quick bite of this and that. A chicken panini with **fluffy** fries and a 3-meat **casserole** with green beans and mashed potatoes.

- A casserole is a dish made of meat and vegetables that have been cooked slowly in a liquid. 

That's a stuffed airplane. I'm sending it to Mikey's friend. I hope he likes it. I really enjoy buying Christmas gifts for people...but wrapping those gifts takes a LOT of time. And a lot of tape!!

 Are you playing Santa this year? Send us some pictures of you wrapping gifts! And your tree! With the decorations!! And your foods!! And describe everything!! It's a great opportunity to practice English, okay?

Grandma and Grandpa **kicked Christmas off with** those presents under the tree!! Doesn't it look beautiful! All of those presents...almost ALL of them are for Mikey. I'm SO jealous~~ 

No!! Of course, I'm not^^ I am grateful for the loving family. There's NOTHING better than family^^



LME 28 <http://archive.aweber.com/ddm_membership/5cNxZ/h/Lesson_28_Americana_Monday.htm>

**TO LEARN: my mom’s affairs, blizzards, torrential desert rains, tread, fender-benders, a deadly pile-up, a dishwasher, bottles and nipples, public bathrooms**

 

Hi ,

I recently, as many of you know, traveled across the US to the state of Nevada to be with my dad. My mother passed away, so I spent time with him and we took care of **my mom’s affairs** *(things like her funeral, insurance, documents, banks…)*. It was a very sad occasion, but it was nice to spend time with my father.

My dad and I had many conversations—among them, about traveling. On this trip, I drove for nearly 60 hours! I traveled through 13 states! I drove through three **blizzards** *(blinding snow storms)* and **torrential desert rains** *(very heavy rains which cause flooding)*. Driving conditions were REALLY bad.

In October, I replaced my tires, so the **tread** *(see the picture below)* was great. And in Las Vegas, I had the oil changed and air filter replaced, so the engine was running smoothly.

And thankfully, we traveled SAFELY.

The only **fender-benders** *(small accidents where injuries are minimal if any)* I saw were in the cities. No big accidents, although there was **a deadly pile-up** *(an accident involving several vehicles and had at least one person die)* south of us on Friday. The pile-up occurred in Kansas and one woman lost her life.

Our hotel rooms were decent. Only one place had a “smell”, but it wasn’t too obnoxious. Every place we stayed had **a dishwasher**(the machine that washes your dishes!) in the room and my wife loved that. Dishwashers help keep my son’s **bottles and nipples** *(milk bottles and rubber nipples for babies)* clean because of the SUPER hot water.

Gas, I discovered, is cheaper where I live now than in Nevada! I paid $1.89/gallon of gas near my home—$2.89 in Nevada~

We ate *fast food* on the road. I stuck to **Taco Bell** and **Subway**. My wife preferred **Panera Bread**…but we could only find one that was convenient. Mikey, he had nature’s finest—breastmilk. Mikey and his food—that’s why we didn’t fly. You cannot take liquids (milk bottles) on an airplane in the USA. Isn’t that ridiculous?

**Public bathrooms**… *(toilet facilities open to the public~)* As a guy, NO problem for me. But it’s a different story for women. Overall, they weren’t too bad.

Finally, coffee! I drank a LOT of **Starbucks** on the road. The triple espressos were keeping me awake. Along with my **Gorilla Rush**. **Out of the 60 hours of driving, I drove at least 57**. My wife **filled in during a few tough spots** when I was feeling **drowsy.**

America, the USA, is a HUGE place! I do recommend driving in the USA. But plan carefully! If you have questions about traveling in America, let me know.

Somebody told me driving is therapeutic.

- therapeutic: If something is therapeutic, it helps you to relax or to feel better about things, especially about a situation that made you unhappy.

I agree. For me, it is a form of meditation. Not city driving! Country driving. Down roads with no other cars. Maybe some animals. Lots of fields. Forests. A bridge. A barn. A lonely stop sign.

For me, it's soothing. Comforting. Therapeutic. When you need some PEACE...where do you go?
What do you do? Do you have a special place?

I would LOVE to see a picture. If you share your pictures, I'll share mine, okay?

- Aha!! Evgueni is out with his family enjoying a winter carnival
- Carnival: A carnival is a public festival during which people play music and sometimes dance in the streets. 

Football is NOT ONLY an American sport--it's very popular in Canada, too. The rules are slightly different, but just a tiny bit. But Canadian Football Cookies?! WOW! I'm a fan!

Hi Evgueni, thanks for sharing such FUN pictures with us! **Keep them coming!!** 

- Hi everyone!  My fresh pics! I went out **cross-country skiing**  at Brumal park. Do you ski? 

 Hi Andrey! I LOVE cross-country skiing. When I was a teenager, I even **raced a little**. Actually, I **intend on** teaching Mikey how to race when he gets older. There are THREE types of skiing that are very popular--do you know them? Send an email if you know what they are!

- intend on doing sth. / to do : If you intend to do something, you have decided or planned to do it.

- Luka is a **cutie** but also a fighter when attacked. He has **fought off** a Husky-sized Husky mixture before, was more than ready to fight an Amstaff and was wounded in fights at least twice. Once it **required stitches.**

Thankfully, the great majority of dogs are friendly with him and **he’s free to be just a cutie most of the time ^_^**

The new skateboarding season **is taking shape** but do NOT worry... I don’t have time to learn tricks anymore because.

I’m drawing!!!! You like these glasses? Well, I’m kind of ambivalent about them. That’s why...

- Ambivalent: If you say that someone is ambivalent about something, they seem to be uncertain whether they really want it, or whether they really approve of it. 
  She remained ambivalent about her marriage. 

I’m relearning perspective (I studied it when I was in high school). Look at my freehand though (drawing straight lines without a ruler). 10 weeks in and the progress is there. I wouldn’t be able to do it without you^^

 I found a course on it for $12... **Took some looking to find this stuff at that price** but it came as a side effect of browsing **heaps of drawing tutorials**. The year was 1994 but these things haven’t changed since the **Renaissance**!

- heaps of times

Matt's English (grammar) Book will be just as perfect as the recipe for Tajine that a student shared with me. You better believe it! 

Hello Coach Matt,  You are not sharing the recipe? How SELFISH! And WHY are you pushing Luka into fights? STOP that!!

And it's true...drawing hasn't changed much since the Renaissance!! So funny!

Be careful on the skateboard and keep doing what you're doing!



- That's my mom and dad! In love for half a century.

Mom's favorite meal. Cheeseburgers and fries. Dad makes THE BEST. It's strange; there is nothing special in his hamburger recipe, but he always makes them taste PERFECT.

Driving out to Nevada was TERRIBLE. Emotionally it was very tough, but the road conditions were atrocious. The road you see above--the speed limit is 75 MPH (120 KPH). But NO ONE was driving that fast on this day. I was keeping the speed at about 45 MPH (70 KPH).

- atrocious: If you describe something as atrocious, you are emphasizing that its quality is very bad. 
  I remain to this day fluent in Hebrew, while my Arabic is atrocious. 

Drank many Starbucks **caramel macchiatos** on the road! In an email lesson a few weeks ago, we learned about TIP JARS. Remember? Here's a Starbucks where they are asking you:

Who is better? Cardi B or Nicki Minaj? You add money (your tip) to the cup you prefer. I added NOTHING!

Selling cookies in the bitter cold. This was at a gas station in Nebraska. It was SUPER cold and very windy.  But when I saw **Girl Scout cookies for sale**...I could NOT resist!! My dad's favorite kind are peanut butter cookies. Mom's favorites were the mint cookies.

- scout: A scout is someone who is sent to an area of countryside to find out the position of an enemy army. 
  They set off, two men out in front as scouts, two behind in case of any attack from the rear. 
  - scout as a verb: If you scout somewhere for something, you go through that area searching for it. 
    I wouldn't have time to scout the area for junk.  / A team of four was sent to scout for a nuclear test site.  / I have people scouting the hills already. 
    

I bought the mint cookies. SO delicious! **Supporting #GirlScoutsoftheUSA**

Three generations of men. I talk with my dad every day now...but being there with him was the best. I miss you dad.

How about some **Wednesday Wisdom** regarding learning English?!

We get a LOT of email every day. And today I want to share a common WORRY that we get:

In other words, work *little by little* on getting rid of that shame. In fact, WELCOME them. **Mistakes that don't kill you** **will make you stronger**! 

1. **JOIN US**! 😊

Seriously! We aim to show "the truth" about learning a language.

The truth is: Spoken language doesn't follow the rules of Written language.

**Speaking is NOT writing.**

**Writing is NOT Speaking!**

Speaking is like a play—it’s happening in the moment. It’s LIVE. You can always rehearse before the real event, but you only get one chance to do it LIVE!

Writing is like a movie—it’s NOT live. You can try things out and experiment and do it again and again. When you’re confident, then you send it out.

**The rules ARE different!**

With those two tips AND perseverance, I can't see why you couldn't get past the hurdle! We’re here to help you. Let’s do it!

LEM 31<http://archive.aweber.com/ddm_membership/ASgsZ/h/Lesson_31_DIRTY_Restaurants.htm>

When you are away from home around lunchtime, where do you like to eat?

When I lived in Korea, the BEST places for lunch were small restaurants that actually don’t look like they’re very clean. In Korea they call them “Driver Restaurants” or “Gisa Sikdang”. They are VERY popular with taxi drivers, hence the name! And I absolutely LOVED them!!

We have them in the USA, too. The “nice” name for those restaurants is a “**diner**”. But the more common name is a **greasy spoon**!

Why do we call them **greasy spoons**? Because when they bring you a fork, spoon and knife; one of them (often the spoon) is still dirty!!! GROSS!

But those restaurants have the best food.

 Just make sure you don’t look TOO closely. You might find it kind of dirty~~ **Hygiene** (cleanliness) is not as important as taste~!! Send us a picture of YOUR favorite greasy spoon and tell us what their BEST food is!

Have a super lunch^^

Phrasal Verb Friday!

Today let’s focus on **MAKING A MISTAKE**~

We all make mistakes. Some people make more mistakes than other people, right? What about you?!

Of course, the important thing: Learn from our mistakes.

 But in reality, many of us REPEATEDLY make the same mistakes. If you are repeatedly making mistakes in English—you need a COACH! 

So, the next time you make a mistake, try using one of these expressions: 

**I flubbed up.**    (SAFE in all situations—usually not a serious mistake)

**I mucked up.**    (SAFE in all situations—usually not a serious mistake)

**I messed up.**    (SAFE in all situations—could be a simple OR a serious mistake)

**I screwed up.**   (SAFE in MOST situations. Use it with friends/acquaintances. Frequently a serious mistake)

**I f’d up.**              **[I effed up]** (NOT SAFE in MOST situations. If you use it, use it only amongst close friends. The “f’d” is short for “fuc*ed”. Use it when you REALLY screw up!)

Does Play Help Develop Bigger, Better Brains? Bryant Furlow Investigates.
A   Playing is a serious business. Children engrossed in a make-believe world, fox cubs play-fighting or kittens teasing a ball of string aren’t just having fun. Play may look like a carefree and exuberant way to pass the time before the hard work of adulthood comes along, but there’s much more to it than that. For a start, play can even cost animals their lives. Eighty percent of deaths among juvenile fur seals occur because playing pups fail to spot predators approaching. It is also extremely expensive in terms of energy. Playful young animals use around two or three percent of their energy cavorting, and in children that figure can be closer to fifteen percent.‘Even two or three percent is huge,’ says John Byers of Idaho University. ‘You just don’t find animals wasting energy like that,’ he adds. There must be a reason.

B   But if play is not simply a developmental hiccup, as biologists once thought, why did it evolve? The latest idea suggests that play has evolved to build big brains. In other words, playing makes you intelligent. Playfulness, it seems, is common only among mammals, although a few of the larger-brained birds also indulge. Animals at play often use unique signs-tail-wagging in dogs, for example—to indicate that activity superficially resembling adult behavior is not really in earnest. A popular explanation of play has been that it helps juveniles develop the skills they will need to hunt, mate and socialize as adults. Another has been that it allows young animals to get in shape for adult life by improving their respiratory endurance. Both these ideas have been questioned in recent years.

C   Take the exercise theory. If play evolved to build muscle or as a kind of endurance training, then you would expect to see permanent benefits. But Byers points out that the benefits of increased exercise disappear rapidly after training stops, so any improvement in endurance resulting from juvenile play would be lost by adulthood. ‘If the function of play was to get into shape,’ says Byers, ‘the optimum time for playing would depend on when it was most advantageous for the young of a particular species to do so. But it doesn’t work like that.’ Across species, play tends to peak about halfway through the suckling stage and then decline.

D   Then there’s the skills-training hypothesis. At first glance, playing animals do appear to be practicing the complex manoeuvres they will need in adulthood. But a closer inspection reveals this interpretation as too simplistic. In one study, behavioral ecologist Tim Caro, from the University of California, looked at the predatory play of kittens and their predatory behavior when they reached adulthood. He found that the way the cats played had no significant effect on their hunting prowess in later life.

E   Earlier this year, Sergio Pellis of Lethbridge University, Canada, reported that there is a strong positive link between brain size and playfulness among mammals in general. Comparing measurements for fifteen orders of mammal, he and his team found larger brains (for a given body size) are linked to greater playfulness. The converse was also found to be true. Robert Barton of Durham University believes that, because large brains are more sensitive to developmental stimuli than smaller brains, they require more play to help mould them for adulthood. ‘I concluded it’s to do with learning, and with the importance of environmental data to the brain during development,’ he says.

F   According to Byers, the timing of the playful stage in young animals provides an important clue to what’s going on. If you plot the amount of time a juvenile devotes to play each day over the course of its development, you discover a pattern typically associated with a ‘sensitive period’-a brief development window during which the brain can actually be modified in ways that are not possible earlier or later in life. Think of the relative ease with which young children-but not infants or adults-absorb language. Other researchers have found that play in cats, rats and mice is at its most intense just as this ‘window of opportunity’ reaches its peak.

G   ‘People have not paid enough attention to the amount of the brain activated by play,’says Marc Bekoff from Colorado University. Bekoff studied coyote pups at play and found that the kind of behavior involved was markedly more variable and unpredictable than that of adults. Such behavior activates many different parts of the brain, he reasons. Bekoff likens it to a behavioral kaleidoscope, with animals at play jumping rapidly between activities. ‘They use behavior from a lot of different context-- predation, aggression, reproduction,’ he says. ‘Their developing brain is getting all sorts of stimulation.’

H   Not only is more of the brain involved in play than was suspected, but it also seems to activate higher cognitive processes. ‘There’s enormous cognitive, involvement in play,’ says Bekoof. He points out that play often involves complex assessments of playmates, ideas of reciprocity and the use of specialized signals and rules. He believes that play creates a brain that has greater behavioral flexibility and improved potential for learning later in life. The idea is backed up by the work of Stephen Siviy of Gettysburg College. Siviy studied how bouts of play affected the brain’s levels of a particular chemical associated with the stimulation and growth of nerve cells. He was surprised by the extent of the activation. ‘Play just lights everything up,’ he says. By allowing link-ups between brain areas that might not normally communicate with each other, play may enhance creativity.

I   What might further experimentation suggest about the way children are raised in many societies today? We already know that rat pups denied the chance to play grow smaller brain components and fail to develop the ability to apply social rules when they interact with their peers. With schooling beginning earlier and becoming increasingly exam-orientated, play is likely to get even less of a look-in. Who knows what the result of that will be?

Snowpocalypse 
Snowpocalypse left Seattle a gift, and it's potholes (by David Kroman) <https://crosscut.com/2019/02/snowpocalypse-left-seattle-gift-and-its-potholes?utm_source=Crosscut+Weekly+-+022319&utm_medium=email>

Have you had some bumpy car and bus rides lately? You aren't imagining things.

Ever since the 50-year snow event earlier this month, potholes have invaded Seattle streets.

To see the damage “all you have to do is drive around the city,” said a mechanic with Moss Alley Motors. They’re seeing more flat tires at both Moss Alley Motors on Capitol Hill and at Les Schwab in West Seattle.

Potholes form every winter as water seeps into cracks and then freezes. But when there’s snow on the ground, it’s made worse by the use of tire chains, which can abrade on bare concrete.

On a normal day, the Seattle Department of Transportation may create between 10 and 20 work orders to fill potholes around the city, she said. But on Tuesday, just as the last bits of snow seemed to finally be melting, SDOT created 135 new work orders to fix potholes — an increase of up to 1,250 percent. That’s closer to what SDOT typically receives in an entire week.

But don't expect all of the potholes on your neighborhood streets to be filled in anytime soon.

Hi ,

Americana Monday!

Piggy Banks! 

Nearly everyone in America has a piggy bank. I had several. My first piggy bank was actually a beagle. My grandpa gave it to me—he had a real beagle and I loved it!

- beagle beagles 
  A beagle is a short-haired black and brown dog with long ears and short legs. It is kept as a pet or sometimes used for hunting. 

Now I use a candy dish as a piggy bank. It'll take a year, I guess, to fill up nicely. So, the question is—what do you do with your excess change? What can you do if you’re **drowning in** change?!

- drowning in :

A few options:

- Stash it: If you stash something valuable in a secret place, you store it there to keep it safe. (INFORMAL) 
  We went for the bottle of whiskey that we had stashed behind the bookcase. 
  Andrews had stashed money away in secret offshore bank accounts. 

Put it in jars and buckets and garbage cans and forget about them! Good luck moving them!

- Tip it

Every time you get change, dump it in the tip jar! 

- Spend it

Count out the coins when paying the cashier. The people behind you will hate you—but hey! Money is money!

- **Cash it in**

Take it to the bank and deposit it or exchange it.


BUT…problem.

Many banks will only take coins IF you have an account. And many banks will only take the coins if they are rolled (putting them into little paper tubes like below). AND STILL, some banks will charge you!

COINSTAR!

You can find these coin counting machines in most big stores like Walmart. They’ll take care of ALL your coins. For a fee. Typically 10%!!! To me, that’s not a fee, that’s STEALING! OR…be real nice and just select the DONATE option and give it all away to your favorite charity.

 BONUS SECRET:

Use a **self-checkout machine** at a store and TAKE YOUR TIME adding your coins to it! Go at a time when there aren’t many customers and no one but the store manager will be mad!

A quick recap: stash it, tip it, spend it, cash it in, go to Coinstar, go through the self-checkout

Show us some support! I work REALLY hard to create great content for you all. 

**Your help is greatly appreciated**! Please look through the following links and again, THANK YOU!!

Hi ,First of all: Happy Birthday, Mikey!! It’s my son’s FIRST birthday😊

 Okay, let’s study!! Wednesday Words…a quiz!

 Using the articles A, AN and THE are tricky. Confusing! Annoying!! But for native English speakers—using them is easy. We don’t even think about it. It’s natural. So, how can you LEARN how to use articles?

Read and pay attention.

Listen and pay attention.

Use them and have a coach (teacher) tell you when you are wrong.

If you are taking an English class—especially if you are in DDM or PIRF—start paying attention to every article. The only way to LEARN them is to figure them out.

ANYWAY…it’s confusing☹ I know. But again, the ONLY thing you can do…practice.

 So, here’s a short paragraph. I want you to insert the CORRECT article. Do your best. I will put the ANSWERS in the link below. I won’t explain the answers—YOU figure it out.

 Choose the correct article (A/AN/THE) for each blank!


           fairy-tale country of Liechtenstein is                   only nation to be located completely in         Alps.

**TO LEARN: ships, battleships, cruise ships, cargo ships, ship, shipping ships, the Blue Marlin**

Sometimes languages can be fun. And today I’m going to show you one of those times!

 What are these?


They’re **vessels**—or more commonly—ships.

What do ships do?

- **Battleships** are used in war.

- **Cruise ships** are used for tourism

- **Cargo** ships are used for hauling things. Instead of “haul” we can also say “ship”. So, cargo ships ship things.


To ship (to haul) means to MOVE something from A to B. We could call cargo ships shipping ships, right? Instead of “Cargo ships move things” we could say “Shipping ships ship things.”

A ship that ships cars—we could call it a “car-shipping ship”. So, in the picture below we could say, “This vessel is **hauling a load of cars.**” Or, “This shipping ship ships cars”.


A ship that ships coal—a coal-shipping ship. We could say, “**This vessel is hauling coal.**” Or, “This shipping ship ships coal.”


What kind of ship do you think this is?


It’s a ship-shipping ship!! It’s called the **Blue Marlin**. It ships ships and other HUGE things. Here it is shipping an oil drilling platform!


Here’s your challenge! Can you DESCRIBE WHAT IS HAPPENING in this picture?


Here’s the PRECISE sentence:

**The Blue Marlin ship with a load of other cargo vessels is at sea moving its stuff.**

But here it is again in a FUNNIER version!

**A ship-shipping ship shipping shipping ships ships ships!**

TO LEARN: call up, phone up, hang on, hang up, call back, hang up on SMO

 Hi ,

Phone-related phrasal verbs!! How many do you see in the little paragraph below?

>  Today I called up my dad and as soon as he answered he said, “Hang on!” and then he hung up. Then he phoned me up and did it again! So, I called him back and told him NOT to hang up on me again!

SIX!

 Today I **called up** my dad and as soon as he answered he said, “**Hang on**!” and then he **hung up**. Then he **phoned** me **up** and did it again! So, I **called** him **back** and told him NOT to **hang up on** me again!

 And those six phrasal verbs are SUPER common. We use them every day. I want you to use them, too.

**To call up**: to call someone

**To phone up**: to call someone

**To hang on**: to wait

**To hang up**: to end the phone call

**To call back**: to call someone AGAIN

**To hang up on SMO**: to end the phone call abruptly/rudely!

 We use **UP** to “intensify” (strengthen/stress) the main verb.

**ON** is used to imply “continuation” or “not stopping” the main verb.

**BACK** means to “main verb AGAIN” 

Make sentences using those verbs. Here are a couple more examples.

- Today I **called up** my dad. I will **phone** him **up** again on Sunday.
- While on the phone, I asked John to **hang on** because I needed to turn off the TV.
- When I call someone, I usually **hang up** after it rings for five times.
- My wife left a text message asking me to **call** her **back**.
- Don’t **hang up on** me—it’s very rude.

TO LEARN: spring ahead, Daylight Saving Time, DST, Standard Time, fall back, Summer Time, Benjamin Franklin

 Hi , This Sunday it begins. Chaos! Many countries around the world CHANGE their clocks in the spring and fall—but the USA does it differently than most~

We “**spring ahead**” in the springtime in the USA—it’s called **Daylight Saving Time** (**DST**)! The second Sunday in March is the time Americans change their clocks one hour ahead (spring ahead). And that allows us more time in the evening to enjoy the sunlight—we’re “saving” daylight!

In November, the USA goes back to **STANDARD TIME**. The clocks go back. We “**fall back**” on first Sunday in November.

In Europe—they call it **SUMMER TIME**. It begins on the last Sunday in March and ends on the last Sunday in October. Much easier to remember if you ask me~~

The map below shows you three things. In red, the countries that **HAVE** Daylight Saving Time. In grayish-pink, countries that have **HAD** DST, but not anymore. And in dark gray, countries that have **NEVER** had DST.

**Benjamin Franklin**—one of the USA’s Founding Fathers—**is rumored to** have created the idea of DST. He joked that people would save on candle-burning if they simply woke up earlier in the summer!

Most history books will tell you that the Germans and Austrians were the first to use it in 1916. HOWEVER, a small town in Canada, what’s known today as Thunder Bay, was the first to use it back in 1908!

**Does your country have DST? When does it start?** 

A quick recap: **spring ahead,** **Daylight Saving Time****,** **DST****,** **Standard Time****,** **fall back, Summer Time, Benjamin Franklin**

- Thank you for your birthday wishes, Anita! Mikey received a few cards from relatives, but I must say; your card is the BEST! Why? Because it's **made for a one-year-old baby!** Mikey sees the card and he starts smiling right away!! Mikey says, "Thank you SO much, Auntie Anita!!



Time to **hit the store!** February 27th was Mikey's birthday and it was COLD!! -17 Celsius! Fortunately, him and I are **polar bears** and we **THRIVE in the bitterly cold weather**. More COLD! More SNOW! More ICE! Just give us some hot chocolate, too! (Did you see that we have **matching shirts?! Black & Red checkered button-downs!)**

I'm at a store called Menards. They sell EVERYTHING you can imagine when it comes to your home. **Building supplies, sinks, grass seed and food!**

 And **birdseed**, too! Do you see WHO is **perched on** the top rack of the birdseed section?!!

The little bird is living in the bird feed **aisle!** **What a genius!**

Chili and cornbread. This is a HUGE thing in America. And my wife is a great cook. **Her chili is perfect (a bit on the spicy side) and her cornbread is amazing (not too sweet)**. But...the combination for me...Just so-so. I'm not sure why SO many Americans LOVE this food combination. Do you have some popular food combinations in your country? If so, PLEASE take some pictures and show us. **DON'T GOOGLE IMAGE!!**

**TO LEARN: see, look, look at, watch**

One of the BEST parts of DDM—answering my students’ questions. And a lot of their questions start with:

**What’s the difference between…**

And I absolutely LOVE those questions. I love to explain NOT ONLY the difference in meaning, but **the difference in nuance!** “Nuance” means HOW something is used or WHY one word is better than the other word.

So, today, I have FOUR words (all verbs) for you—what’s the difference between them.

**SEE** – to fill our eyes with! **Usually unintentional, sometimes intentional—something ENTERS your vision!** Also, it refers to your visual ability.

- At night, I see the stars.
- In the jungle, I see lots of green
- I want to see a movie.
- I can see very well.

**LOOK** – to use our eyes

- Don’t look—it’s a surprise!
- Look! He’s running away!

**LOOK AT** – to focus our eyes at something or someone

- Look at my **fat tummy!**
- Don’t look at the sun.
- Are you looking at those women?

**WATCH** – to LOOK AT something that is moving!

- I’m watching TV. (the TV doesn’t move, but the images on the screen do)
- I like watching sports.
- **Watching my son grow is wonderful!**

From our experience, Hugo’s documentation may be a little **daunting to read and digest** for beginners

LEM 41<http://archive.aweber.com/ddm_membership/NCud3/h/Lesson_41_Common_SLOGANS.htm>

It’s a slogan that EVERY American knows. It’s taught to children in elementary school by firefighters! It means:

- **STOP**: if there’s a fire, STOP what you are doing!
- **DROP**: if you smell smoke, DROP down to the floor!
- **ROLL**: if your clothes are on fire, ROLL in order to put out the fire!

**Slogans** are phrases that SOUND GOOD, are EASY to MEMORIZE and have an IMPORTANT MESSAGE. Slogans are **catchy**—

- to be catchy means they are easily memorized and used.

Here are a few more catchy slogans that most Americans know:

Better safe than sorry! (Be SAFE at work!)

Click it or ticket! (wear your seat belts!)


Don’t be a fool, use the proper tool.


When in doubt, check it out. (double check your medicines.


Only YOU can prevent forest fires.


Take a bite out of crime. (report crimes and criminals to the police)


Friends don’t let friends drive drunk.


Stop the texts. Stop the wrecks.

- To wreck something means to completely destroy or ruin it. 
  He wrecked the garden.

**TO LEARN: getting dressed, dress down, dress up, dress up SMT, dress SMO down**

 Let’s talk about getting dressed. Wearing clothes.

Lots of people in America love Fridays because it’s a chance to **dress down** even at work. To “dress down” means that you do NOT have to **wear the typical business suit or dress to the office**. You can NOT wear blue jeans and a t-shirt, but you can just wear slacks (dress pants) and a regular button-down shirt.

Of course, Monday through Thursday you need to dress up, but on Fridays you can dress down.

Since I work at home—I can dress down every day! Actually, the only day I dress up is when I go to church! When I do leave the house though, I dress up a little. Not a suit, but a nice pair of pants and a nice shirt.

Did you know that you can also **dress up a resume?** You could dress up anything, actually! To “dress up” can also mean to “make something look nice/pretty”! Below, the resume on the left is “boring” but the resume on the right is much better—it’s dressed up!


I dress up my Email lessons to you with different colors and pictures!

And when I was in the army—I saw an entire group of soldiers get dressed down for running inside during the **national anthem**! Yes, to “dress someone down” means to YELL AT someone. In the military, when the national anthem is played, soldiers must stand at attention and **salute the US flag.**

- salute: if you salute someone, you greet them or show your respect with a formal sign. Soldiers usually salute officers by raising their right hand so that their fingers touch their forehead


Don’t worry, though, this usage of “dress down” is NOT common 😊

 A quick recap: getting dressed, dress down, dress up, dress up SMT, dress SMO down



### 3/9/2019

- the exorbitant excise tax of 38%! 
- **Prior to** admittance your driver license is scanned into their database and I can just imagine the **many prying eyes who may gain access to that information.**
- Immediately we noted their local accents, which **sparked a conversation about** “where are you from?”. 
- What was interesting is that Ed, while focusing in on this young woman’s speech patterns, **he had trouble placing from where she hailed….** New Hampshire, and interestingly, she intimated that when she first moved to Venice, she hated that people would frequently comment about her unusual New England accent. 
- When I asked why, she exclaimed that she didn’t want people to think she was “a hick from the sticks”. I assured her that she did not present herself as an uneducated “hick”. 
  - hick:  you refer to someone as a hick, you are saying in a rude way that you think they are uneducated and stupid because they come from the countryside. (INFORMAL) 
- My memories of Venice Beach go back to a short stay I did in about 1977 – ’78. Venice to me was cool in some aspects, but so odd in many others. My memories include skate-boarders **in abundance** (not so common elsewhere at the time), people **dance-roller-blading**, serious muscle-builders showing off their weight-lifting **prowess** on the boardwalk, as well as freaky **hair-dos** and and **style of attire** that **were far ahead of their time**…..now these sights are almost universal around the country, especially in college towns. **California always the trend-setter.**
  - prowess: [U] (formal) great skill at doing sth: academic / sporting / technical prowess ◆ He was complimented on his prowess as an oarsman.
  - freaky: If someone or something is freaky, they are very unusual in some way. (INFORMAL) 
    This guy bore a really freaky **resemblance to** Jones. 
    ADJ-GRADED = weird, strange
  - attire: [U] (formal) clothes: dressed in formal evening attire
- One of the more **pleasant aspects** of re-connecting with Ed was to see an old friend who took his life and health seriously. **The results show a man, same age as me, in good health and content with where he is in life at the approach of the senior years.** I still surprise my self when I say things like “approach of senior years”! It is a pleasant optimism. Contrast to the growing list of old friends, many of whom were **mutual friends of Ed and I** back in the day, who didn’t make it to their sixtieth birthday. It was **refreshing** to reflect on **respective life choices** and **the relationship they have to longevity.** **Truth be told**, the **barrage of news** that so many old pals had passed in such a short period of time was a bit depressing.
  - refreshing : You say that something is refreshing when it is pleasantly different from what you are used to. 
  - respective life choice 
  - truth be told
  - barrage: ~ (of sth) **a large number of sth**, such as questions or comments, that are directed at sb very quickly, one after the other, often in an aggressive way: a barrage of questions / criticisms / complaints ◆ the media's barrage of attacks on the President's wife
- I return to blogging and discover that in one of the recent WordPress updates the entire format has changed. I’ve not quite figured out how to get back to the previous set-up. Until then I am having trouble posting pictures within the articles. Hope I can figure it out, because I don’t care for this layout.



It’s been two decades since I last visited the “*Golden State*” and even longer since I was on planet L.A. On my most recent trip I decided to change my travel route to Jinan, China. As regular readers know I have always **flown out of** Newark into Beijing, then high-speed train to Jinan….and **it is an arduous journey**, particularly at my age. There are now direct flights into Jinan from Los Angeles. I thought I would try this **route** and see if it would be more convenient to travel via L.A. on future trips. In terms of **avoiding the hassle of getting through Beijing**, skipping the **overnight hotel stay** and not having to take the train as the last part of the journey going to Jinan it should be easy. There is no doubt that **departing out of Jinan International is a breeze.** It is a small airport with very short lines and virtually **no waiting going through security before boarding.** However, getting to L.A. **as the first leg of the trip** is not without its own issues and going this route requires one over-night stay in a hotel in Los Angeles. There are a few benefits though…..More on that later.

- arduous: Something that is arduous is difficult and tiring, and involves a lot of effort. 
- hassle:  A hassle is a situation that is difficult and involves problems, effort, or arguments with people. (INFORMAL) 

Some context to help understand **the dynamic of** America’s east coast -v- west coast competitive viewpoint, or is it **a clash of lifestyles**? As a native of the east coast, I had youthful dreams of *the Golden State* — Sunny beaches, **laid-back lifestyle,** fewer crowds, more modern cities, more youthful **populace**, etc. Conversely, some folks who grew up on the “*left coast*“, especially Californians, have aspirations of reaching their dreams in NYC – the competitive **hustle and bustle** of Wall Street, the Manhattan f**ashion scene**, and **some may be drawn to D.C.** if they are aspiring politicos. There is also **a sort of rivalry** between the two coasts related to **which place is nicer to live, more hip, less stodgy, etc.** It is important to point out that the demographics of the U.S. have **been in constant flux**, but generally speaking, starting with my generation, **there has been a massive flow of people from the northeast to the west-southwest.** California has **absorbed** much of that migration.

In my youth, I couldn’t wait to get out of New Jersey. It was too crowded, **too restrictive in its political thinking, there was a sense that it lacked innovation, and more**. So, I moved west. I lived in Colorado, a state still **dear to my heart** in some ways – mostly **nostalgic**. I also lived and worked in Arizona, a very popular place for retirees seeking sunshine and long warm seasons, but summers are too damn hot for many who migrate there. Montana is another place **I was drawn to for its sheer wildness and rugged lifestyle.** Wide open spaces, plenty of good fishing and hunting and a **general attitude of the populace that it’s best to mind your own business.** Understandably though, many wealthy Californians have moved to areas of the Pacific Northwest and mountain states as part of the “white-flight” **away from the ghetto-ization of many areas in the “*Promised Land*“.** Sadly as Californians have emigrated to states like Washington, Oregon and Montana, they have demanded many of the government type services they received in California. This has **had an adverse effect on real estate costs, and worse, it has driven up property taxes.**

For a very long time California has had a reputation for innovation, trend-setting **bordering on a bit of** **kookiness**…. **“*The land of fruits and nuts*”** (and we are not taking about agricultural products) is another nickname. In American politics there is a popular saying that **“*as California goes, so goes the nations.*”** This **comes from that trend-setting for which the state is known**. One example is the traffic law which permits turning right at a red light, after a stop. Across the nation, before the 1970s, the standard was that stopping at a red light meant that no one could proceed until the light turned green. **California amended that for the sake of creating better flow of traffic and it works well.** **Virtually** everywhere in the U.S. that “California standard” has **been adopted as an acceptable traffic rule – unless it is otherwise marked as prohibited.**

Some of the more notable businesses and novelty products that originated in California; [Weatherby rifles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weatherby), sailboats by [Hobie Cat](https://www.hobie.com/about-us/), surfing, skateboarding and [hoola-hoops.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hula_hoop) The aerospace industry grew and developed in large part based in California, as well as the **boom in technology fostered within Silicon Valley.** And of course, the trend toward a more healthy life-style and the attraction to more outdoor activities like camping, biking and hiking were all popularized in California before they **caught on** in the nation and many other parts of the world. The state of California has also had it share of **odd-ball** ideas, particularly in recent years. They even elected [Jerry (“*Governor Moonbeam”*) Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Brown), again, after a 28 year **hiatus**. While there remain strong **enclaves** of economic prosperity throughout California, there are also signs of societal **fraying at the edges.** I noted a tremendous number of **homeless encampments** as I **Uber*ed* around the city.** These various camps were not occupied by just a few **vagrants**, but, rather dozens and dozens of tents. Some under bridges, others on the **fringes** of the freeway or in industrial areas. **The signs of social disorder are showing in no small scale.**

Another progressive move; California has now fully legalized cannabis for recreational use. They were not the first state to pass such legislation, though they were the first state to pass legalization of cannabis for medical use, quite a few years ago. **From the stink of the hotel hallway I think it is safe to say that business is booming in the herb industry!** Funny. It reminded me of visiting Amsterdam.

Online and in the many shops selling cannabis there is an abundance of product variety; f**rom edibles, to concentrates, oils, cbd products for topical treatments to tinctures…and then there is the wide selection of just plain old herb.** From seeds to clones, or grams for personal consumption **all the way up** to pounds of weed with all the latest, **ass-kicking hybrid genetics**. It’s a beautiful thing! They even offer delivery on demand!

Having now check-out the cannabis scene in Colorado and California, I think it is safe to say there is no putting this **genie** back in the bottle. I **concur with** the growing **sentiment** among those state’s inhabitants. The Feds are going to have to get on board. Ah! But there is still a lot of law on the books at federal level that does not recognize cannabis as anything other than a “Schedule I Drug” with no medical value. Additionally, the current Attorney General for the United States, Jeff Sessions is long-time drug warrior. Apparently, AG Sessions would rather chase after weed-smokers than look into the abundance of criminality surrounding the Clinton Foundation, William J. Clinton, Hillary R. Clinton, et.al.
*Amended – 11/8/18 – It’s funny how things can change in just a week. The dearly loathed Jeff Sessions has tendered his letter of resignation and President Trump has accepted it. Perhaps the nation may move forward with more rational drug policy.

Neither is the Fedgov amenable to people of free will exercising their cognitive abilities and disregarding the notion that the ***Almighty State*** knows what is best for their ~~chattel~~ …er, I mean citizens. This is where I get a little **foggy.** So how does this play out over time? Way back in the 1980s when California passed the nations first medical marijuana (cannabis) law, the Feds refused to recognize the state’s right to make such law. As expected they came in with very heavy hands (and boots) and put a lot of the early entrepreneurs out of business. So we shall see how it goes this time….my bet is they will see it all as **a new cash cow and look to take their cut of the action.**

*Additionally amended – 11/8/18 – There are rumblings of Trump legalizing cannabis at the federal level! Wow! With Sessions gone from D.O.J. it could happen. I think it would be wise to allow happen and [here is an article from Reason Magazine](http://reason.com/blog/2018/11/07/its-time-for-congress-to-acknowledge-the) that makes the case for Congress to get with it.

 

- chattel: Chattels are things that belong to you. (OLD-FASHIONED)  They were slaves, to be bought and sold as chattels.  N-VAR 



### 3/10/2019

- It was a big feast for our soul 
  - feast : A feast is a large and special meal. 
    Lunch was a feast of meat and vegetables, cheese, yoghurt and fruit, with unlimited wine. 
    The fruit was often served at wedding feasts. 

After the short visit with my old friend in Los Angeles, I **caught an overnight flight** direct to Jinan. It was cold and the air quality was quite bad when I arrived. The long flight always **wipes me out** and I need a day (at least) to **adjust to** the 13 hour time difference from home.

Echo knew I was eager to have the delicious, local roast chicken from Mi Jia Chicken and I knew we had one more ticket to go before we got a free bird. I woke from an afternoon nap and was told the chicken would be delivered soon and rice and greens were almost ready. Wow, nice treat! And that order of chicken delivered was the 10th ticket = free chicken next time!

I spent most of January in Jinan this year. Early in the month, we visited the Shandong Provincial Museum and our friend Jennifer was so kind to provide an English speaking tour guide. I was pleased when I discovered that this was the same guide who had given me a tour, **along with** some of Team Q members, about three years ago. You can read about that visit by following this link.

One of the highlights of this visit to the museum was the **Exhibition of Unearthed Cultural Relics** from the Ming Mausoleum of Zhu Tan. It was interesting to see relics from this time period.

- relic: an object, a tradition, etc. that has survived from a period of time that no longer exists: The building stands as the last remaining relic of the town's cotton industry. ◆ The pictures on the walls were relics from the days before her marriage.
- Mausoleum: A mausoleum is a building which contains the grave of a famous person or the graves of a rich family. 

Another exhibit showed the remains of Shandong Big Man.


This fellow lived several millennia ago in what is now called Shandong Province. He measured over 185 cm. which is quite remarkable for that time period. Evidence of food abundance at that time in the ancient world.

There was also an exhibition of mostly photographs **documenting the role of Chinese laborers involved in World War One.**

The museum was the only cultural activity in Jinan this trip. We did try to walk after dinner several times each week, though air quality was a concern and face-masks were necessary.

As part of my continuing **rehabilitation** from hip surgery, we initially had a plan to take a **side trip** to Thailand, but we **decided against that idea due to time constraints.** To fly to Bangkok from Jinan is about 5 hours (not including the time to get to the airport and through security checks). From Bangkok to the island of Phuket takes another 2 hour flight and then a ferry ride. Instead we had an extended weekend visit to Hainan Island. Hainan is a popular **resort area** in the South China Sea and only about 3 hours fly time.

Returning to Jinan after our beach holiday, the air quality was so bad that our flight from Sanya was delayed 5 hours. The **cabbie** who drove us from the airport to the house reported that the day before all flights into Jinan were diverted to Qingdao. It really is **remarkable** when the air quality is so poor that visibility at the airport is **diminished to the degree** that planes can not land or **take-off**.


I had a wonderful meal celebrating my birthday with Team Q members! During that dinner, our dear friend Judy graciously shared a short speech about the value of time. **It is far too easy to allow such a precious resource to slip away. Consciously use your time positively, productively and wisely. Time flies, but you are the pilot!**

Another Spring Festival dinner celebration with Echo’s family and other meals with friends. I always enjoy getting together with family and friends in Jinan! Most of my students were preparing to take off and visit with family. **Attending to their filial duty** – to return home and **pay respect to family elders** continues as a **deeply rooted cultural requirement.** Before the **exodus** for the holiday, we did have time for a couple of games of scrabble with Team Q. And Hot-Pot lunch with the girls from Echo’s office, now **affectionately** referred to as Team Cute!

- filial: (formal) connected with the way children behave towards their parents: filial affection / duty
- exodus: ~ (from ...) (to ...) (formal or humorous) a situation in which many people leave a place at the same time: the mass exodus from Paris to the country in the summer ◆ The play was so awful that there was a general exodus from the theatre at the interval.


The foundation of Hot-Pot is the broth. This one is seasoned with garlic cloves, whole dried dates, leeks and haw-berry.


To the broth there are several ingredients added and cooked. A selection of **various fungi**.


Thinly sliced meat, usually beef or lamb.

The broth is brought to a boil and the various ingredients are added. Tofu, vegetables, noodles and almost anything can be put into the broth. Everything cooks in minutes and then each person at the table **scoops out their meal.**

***

**Stay tuned for upcoming articles** about a couple of side trips out of Jinan to Qingdao and Hainan Island.

…Looks like **this year is off to a busy start!**

- If cooking time is too long, the yolk egg looks gray-green. More importantly, the **ferrous ion** in yolk can produce chemical reaction with sulfur ion, forming sulfide ferrous brown **precipitate**. Thus it will **interfere with ion absorption.**
- More importantly the information can also allow me some degree of **introspection**. 
- My favorite picture from Sanya was the sunrise over Yalong Bay. From the low level **grayish clouds**, rising through yellow, with yellow-orange turning to orange-red, to **slate gray** above and finally a **bluish cyan.** **Such a soothing array of delicate hues.** Nice way to start the day!
  - hue: (literary or technical) a colour; a particular shade of a colour: His face took on an unhealthy whitish hue. ◆ Her paintings capture the subtle hues of the countryside in autumn.
     (formal) a type of belief or opinion: supporters of every political hue



Instead of traveling more than 5 hours by air, to a beach resort in Thailand, we chose to visit the Chinese resort Island of Hainan. Only three hours of flying and **no hassle** with international customs. We had been told by a friend whose daughter attends university in Thailand that the customs lines in Thailand are very long and move very slowly.

During our short stay the weather was pleasant, not too hot, but warm enough to **feel the heat of the sun even as a refreshing breeze blew in from the sea**. Water temperatures were comfortable in the pool and in Yalong Bay. January is the coolest month of the year, though the water temperature of the sea remains a constant 20C (68F) year round. Some folks prefer warmer water. I especially liked the layout of the hotel pool. It was a massive structure with 3 waterfalls and irregular shaped upper and lower pools surrounded by tropical plants. We **staked a claim** on a set of **lounge chairs** to relax in the sun.

The view from the balcony of our room was lovely, especially in the early morning. I’m an early riser and I caught this pic at around 6:45.

Sunrise on Yalong Bay.

In the evenings we enjoyed a couple of walks along the beach. Sadly, cigarette smokers carelessly **snub their cigarette butts in the sand** and it makes for an **unsightly litter** on what would otherwise be a beautiful seaside beach. It is shameful that **inconsiderate people** can make a lovely resort area look **crappy**.

During this trip we had a few unhappy food experiences. I am not a big fan of buffets for any meal, but the breakfast buffet was included as part of the hotel package we had booked and we had no luck finding better options nearby. On the first day at breakfast I noted that the **egg offerings** of boiled or fried were not appealing at all. It seems standard in China to fry eggs in too much oil and to allow the egg to brown/burn. I learned in my culinary education, which was heavily influenced by Classic French Cuisine, “any degree of browning is a degree of burning.” …..and I think it is fair to say that the French are recognized for having perfected the art of egg cookery.   The other option of a boiled egg was also overcooked in the extreme.

The proper way to boil an egg; Start with fresh eggs. The eggs should be at room temperature. Place the eggs in a sauce-pot adequate for the task, add cold water to cover and plenty of salt to aid in peeling the shell. Cover with a lid, **place on the fire** and when the water begins to boil, **reduce the heat to simmer** and set a timer for 11 minutes (at sea level). When the eggs are done, quickly remove from the heat. Pour off the hot water and **run cold water over the eggs** for a few minutes. When they are cool enough to handle, peel and serve. The yolk of the eggs should be bright yellow. There should be no gray or green color around the yolk of the egg.   

Here is a link from my beloved Culinary Institute of America to learn more about egg cookery.

Apparently, no one knows this method in all the fancy hotels I’ve stayed throughout China, because every boiled egg I have seen has a gray-green looking egg yolk, indicating they have been cooked for probably 20 minutes or more….tasteless and dry. The next couple of days, my dear Lao Po **diligently** instructed the breakfast cooks on the proper way to scramble eggs with some green onions and a bit of cheese (my favorite) without burning them. She is so good! The rest of the buffet line was just **blah**. The selection of breads was boring. There was only one type of cheese. Much of the fruit was not **fully ripe**, which is a real pity given that we were in the tropics! And much of the hot food was not kept hot. Part of the problem is that none of the **chaffing dishes** had covers to retain the heat from the steam table. The other problem with uncovered serving dishes on a buffet line is one of **sanitation**. I find it particularly **unsettling** that many people in China do not cover their mouths when coughing or sneezing. This presents a serious health concern when it occurs near food. **Coughing and sneezing near uncovered food creates an opportunity for communicable disease to spread**….**everything from the current strain of influenza to Hepatitis or worse.**

Another disagreeable food experience included a crab house where you select fresh seafood from the open-air market on the boardwalk nearby. Then you bring the fish to the restaurant and they will cook according to your preferences, along with some veggies and rice or noodles. Seemed like an interesting concept, right? It was not inexpensive, but unfortunately, the quality of preparation and the degree of cleanliness (plates, glasses and table area) **were both lacking.**

Finally, on our last night, we tried a BBQ buffet at another hotel only to be entirely disappointed with that meal! Similar issues with cold food because it was left uncovered, poor selection and dirty dishes and tables.

It is funny, **in an odd way**, to have so many unpleasant dining experiences on just one short holiday. We are usually pretty good at finding interesting and good quality places to eat, but this trip was bad luck in threes! **The tendency to critique food and service is something that comes from my years working in the Foodservice and Hospitality Industry.** Sometimes critical review can be **perilous** to an enjoyable dining experience or holiday **get-away.**

- perilous: (formal or literary) very dangerous: a perilous adventure / journey

Perhaps the lesson is that while it may be easier and slightly more convenient to book hotel plans with the big international chains, like Sheraton, Marriott, Hyatt, etc., experienced travelers may find better value in the less well known places- **off the beaten path.** It may take a bit more time and research to find such places, but the experience could very well turn out to be better all the way around. Lessons learned.

- off the beaten path:  not known or popular with many people

Based on the languages commonly posted on menus and hotel notifications, Sanya seems to **cater to** a mix of Russian, Korean and Chinese tourists. There were quite a few Russian couples and families with children staying at our hotel.

- cater: ~ (for sb/sth) to provide food and drinks for a social event: [V] (BrE) Most of our work now involves catering for weddings. ◆ [VN] (AmE) Who will be catering the wedding? 



Qingdao is a seaside city with a **thriving** deep water port. The port is ranked as the number eight busiest shipping port in the world!

As a port city it has always **held strategic importance in terms of international commerce**. The city has also been **a point of contention between ambitious foreign powers**. In the early 20th Century, both Japan and Germany had gained interest and investment in Qingdao and the surrounding region, as explained in the following **excerpt** from Encyclopedia Britannica:

“ In 1897 the German government, which had ambitions in this area, **dispatched a force to occupy Qingdao;** the next year it forced the Chinese government to pay an **indemnity** and to grant Germany a 99-year lease on Jiaozhou Bay and the surrounding territory, together with railway and mining rights in Shandong. Qingdao was declared a free port in 1899, and **modern port facilities were installed;** a railway was built to Jinan in 1904. **A modern European-style city was laid out, and a variety of industries were founded.** A branch of the **Imperial Maritime Customs** was established to control the trade of the coast as far south as the new port of Lianyungang in Jiangsu province. In 1914, when Japan declared war on Germany, **its prime purpose was the capture of Qingdao**; the port **capitulated** after a **blockade** in November. The Japanese continued to occupy the city until the Washington Conference of 1922, when the port was returned to China. During that period, however, the Japanese had built up a strong position, both in Qingdao itself and in the Shandong **hinterland**.”

So while Qingdao was not exactly a colony of Germany, **there was substantial German influence in the early development of the city.** Today there remains evidence of that period in time **visible through much of the local architecture**……..While walking near the beach we even met and briefly chatted with a couple of Germans who were there to tour the city.

For lunch after we arrived downtown from the train station, Echo found a Gramma’s Home restaurant and we went for their delicious **braised chicken!** This chicken is different than the **famed** roast chicken in Jinan. This chicken is braised and there remains a good amount of braising liquid in the bottom of the cooking vessel. The juice from the bird is delicious over rice! Nice find. We have enjoyed this restaurant chain since first eating in one in Beijing with Vivian and Julia. Service is fast, prices are reasonable and the food is good. **Follow the link above to read all the great reviews on Trip Advisor.**

- famed: If people, places, or things are famed, they are very well-known. 


Not the best weather for **sunbathing**! Maybe we can revisit in summer and catch these 3 cuties in their bikinis.

Echo’s friend, Nikita met us after lunch and was kind enough to be our driver for the remainder of the stay.


Morning had an opportunity to take her little Cookie to visit the sea for the first time in her 3 years of life!


We found a greenhouse / coffee house. No one wanted coffee so late in the afternoon, but inside the greenhouse were **reminders of the flowers that will come in the warmer months.**

Not surprisingly, the weather was cold and a bit windy. There was a group of men playing soccer on the beach, but the month of January is not really ideal for beach activities. I’m sure that during the warmer months this place would be **jam-packed** with Chinese visitors as well as many international tourists.

**The daylight hours slip away quickly in January. Before we knew it the sun was setting and it was time to leave the beach.**

The morning of our beach visit, we searched for a place that offered Western style breakfast. We found one around the corner from the place we were staying. **To my delight**, I share with you word of my very first scrambled eggs in China, cooked to perfection! Wagas was the name of the place –sounds like a Russian gas company, but the eggs were terrific and the breads were quite good too. Finally, someone in China **adept at** cooking eggs without burning them. I was so happy. I should have **snapped a pic,** but I was so excited I forgot.

Flying out of Beijing to JFK is not the usual way home from Asia for me.  Newark International is the easiest major airport to access when traveling internationally.  I am told that Philadelphia is easy access for folks in NEPA also, though I’ve never flown out of Philly.  

Our plan was to arrive JFK and spend a day and a half in Manhattan with Lily and family doing a few **NYC highlights; museums, sightseeing, dinner, etc.** Unfortunately, I was not feeling well before I left China. Then, **adding in the marathon of getting up on the day of travel at 4:30 AM to take a taxi to the train station, high-speed train to Beijing, then taxi to the airport and fly 14 hours and a dozen time zones (without eating anything during the flight), I was tired and irritable by the time we checked into the hotel….and very hungry.** We all hurried out to catch a taxi to have some of the famous chicken at[ Pio-Pio’s](https://www.piopio.com/locations/upper_west_side.html). The chicken and potatoes saved me from starvation but by morning I hadn’t slept well and I was still exhausted. Knowing that my own bed was just a mere two hours away, I simply wanted to get there and sleep. And so we did….**.but not without some difficulties with respect to getting out of Manhattan**.

We set out from the hotel by taxi to PABT. Shortly after we arrived, it was discovered by one member of the party (not me!) had …hmm misplaced a cell phone. Fortunately, the iPhone feature of “*Find my phone ”* came in to play. The individual who had lost their phone called and discovered that a very kind person found it in the back of the cab. So, now the excitement begins, as we must find a man named Joe somewhere near East Central Park walking his mother’s dog and carrying the missing iPhone! This was achieved at some expense involved in taxi fare **to and fro**, but the honest citizen, Joe in NYC refused to accept a **C-note** for his kindness…..thereby elevating him to an even more noble status. Thank you, Joe!

- to and fro: **in one direction and then in the opposite direction:**
- C-note: A one-hundred dollor bill. C stands for "centum" the Latin word for 100. The word "note" actually come from the bill it's self. 

Ah, but our adventure to leave Manhattan was only beginning. We returned by taxi to PABT to catch the next bus home. Tickets for the 8:30 AM bus to DWG, we waited, boarded at 8:20 and off we went…only to get stuck in a traffic jam, **due to an apparent car crash blocking the [LincolnTunnel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Tunnel).** The driver had no choice but to **head way downtown to** the [Holland Tunnel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holland_Tunnel) and this resulted in an added 60 minutes to what had become the*escape from Manhattan!*

Later, after we were halfway across the **swamps** of Jersey, the driver **encountered another traffic jam** in the vicinity of Routes 280 and 46. Fortunately, the driver **was knowledgable of the local road system and asked for a passenger vote on a couple alternate routes.** We all agreed to keep the **bus rolling**. Due to the first traffic jam it was clear that we would be arriving at our destination more than an hour later than scheduled. Yes, keep rolling. Please.

- swamp

  If you are swamped by things or people, you have more of them than you can deal with. 
  He is swamped with work. 
  The railway station was swamped with thousands of families trying to flee the city. 

I was disappointed that I didn’t have a chance to spend time with Lily and her family, but **I would not have been very good company in such a fatigued condition.** Next time, Lily!

*FOR ANYONE PLANNING A TRIP TO NYC*

Here are a few places well worth visiting during a trip to New York City; 

The top recommendation I offer for any visitor to NYC is the Metropolitan Museum of Art. You can read about the [MET here](http://english-speak-english.com/the-met-sculpture-garden/), and[ here](http://english-speak-english.com/met-sculpture/), an[d here](http://english-speak-english.com/a-day-trip-to-nyc/) and [here](http://english-speak-english.com/ugolino-sons/)….. The collection is extensive and impossible to absorb all in one visit, but i**t is a terrific introduction to the world of art and culture available in the New York Metro area.** 
Go here for info[ about Manhattan ](http://english-speak-english.com/manhattan-island/)with good links for transit info.

Across [Central Park ](http://english-speak-english.com/central-park-new-york/)to the west is an easy walk to find the American Museum of Natural History
[Hayden Planetarium](https://www.amnh.org/our-research/hayden-planetarium) is around the corner. I believe these two attractions are must see places if you have kids / teens.

- planetarium: A planetarium is a building where lights are shone on the ceiling to represent the planets and the stars and to show how they appear to move. 

[MoMA ](http://english-speak-english.com/moma-and/)is another popular destination if you are a fan of Modern Art. It’s a small museum and gets crowded early. Grand Central Station is not far away and worthy of exploration. In fact, all of the places mentioned above are within walking distance (weather permitting).

Lunch or dinner choices are abundant within all budgets and interests in taste. If you are using a smart phone while traveling, get on TripAdvisor, read some reviews and you can usually find something to like.

January in Jinan is a little bit warmer than here, so it was better for my hip **mending** to avoid the **extreme cold of a Pocono winter.** Away I went, but not before shutting down the house water and heating systems. Turning off the water-heater saves a lot of money on the electric bill, as does keeping the heat at lower temperature. When there isn’t anyone staying in the home, I can leave the room temperature set around 45 degrees Fahrenheit. This room temperature would be very uncomfortable if I were home, but while I am away, as long as my water pipes don’t freeze everything should be good. As an extra precaution I also shut off the main water flow into the home. I had three taps open while I shut off the water. This should be sufficient to drain most water out of the pipes. Probably one of the worst things to happen while away, **a burst water pipe can result in major water damage in the home. Taking a small precaution like shutting off the water could save thousands of dollars in repairs.**

Turning on again:

After turning the power back on for the water heater and the major appliances the house began to warm. It takes about an hour to fully warm the hot water tank. Electric heat is simply a matter of flipping on a breaker switch. Electric baseboard heaters are quick to warm the house. They do tend to get a bit dusty. Turning on my main water supply from the well on my property requires that I climb down under the house and **hunker across the cellar floor** for about 15 yards. There, to flip the lever and listen for the flow of water returning through the pipes and on to the **faucets** and shower heads that I left open. Whoosh! All systems go. Now it’s just a matter of letting water run to get any sediment out of the dormant pipes and wait for the heat to take effect.

- dormant: not active or growing now but able to become active or to grow in the future: a dormant volcano ◆ During the winter the seeds lie dormant in the soil.

The car was kept inside the garage – unheated but protected from rain, **sleet** and snow. It started right up after one month of not running. That’s always a welcome sound.

Now, back to my regular schedule. **Hoping the finals weeks of winter go out gently. So many details to get working on. From garden planning, house cleaning, follow-up new business opportunities and more. Happy to be home after a hectic schedule for nearly a month and a half.**

- hectic: A hectic situation is one that is very busy and involves a lot of rushed activity.

I*f you want to live a happy life tie it to a goal not to people or things*.
**Albert Einstein**

Who knew there were [81 TED talks on motivation](https://www.ted.com/talks?topics%5B%5D=motivation)? Now you do!….and plenty of articles about what it is and [how to scientifically maximize it](https://jamesclear.com/motivation).

**Motivation**  

If honesty is to prevail, it is important to admit 
that a lack of motivation can cause one to quit.
Sometimes it may be due to circumstances beyond our control. 
Yet it is hard to argue with anyone whose virtues extol.

- extol: If you extol something or someone, you praise them enthusiastically. 
  Now experts are extolling the virtues of the humble potato. 
  They kept extolling my managerial skills. 
  VB 

Other times it may be hampered by the weather.
It’s best to start and never say never.
It can be the hardest thing to find even if you don’t procrastinate.
Yet often times we say it can wait.

Then, there may be times when it simply can not be found.
It can come and go, like the **turning of the tides ebb and flow .**
Now and again and from time to time, it may be high or sometimes low.
It can be **too many irons in the fire** or not enough to inspire.
**No one can give it to you. It comes from within.**
It has everything to do with choices, goals and priorities.
And when you find it you may grin.   

Here is a [very good link to learn about how to start an exercise program and stay motivated.](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/healthy-living/how-to-start-exercising-and-stick-to-it.htm)

I’ve had some trouble getting motivated to **resume my exercise program** since returning from travel. One thing I have found to be true is on the days when I have low motivation, but I push myself to go and work-out anyway, I always come back **feeling better both physically and mentally.** So I encourage anyone to keep going. And remember; No pain no gain!

------

Wondering. We all do it. The two songs are interesting contrasts to **ponder**. The musings in the first song speak of youthful love. Simplicity, idealism and a sense of ease. **A curious feeling of wonderment at what the future may hold.**

- ponder: If you ponder something, you think about it carefully. 
  I found myself constantly pondering the question: 'How could anyone do these things?'. 

Contrast to the revisiting of the same musical tune, yet with more **foreboding** lyrics and written years later.

- foreboding: Foreboding is a strong feeling that something terrible is going to happen. 
  His triumph was overshadowed by an uneasy sense of foreboding. 

Thoughts of a future in which o**ver-population, environmental degradation, government corruption, cultural decay have brought a darker world reality than that seen through eyes of youthful dreaminess.** Perhaps a **metaphor** representing the maturing relationship and the stresses of the outside world, not so ideal, have tested love that was once young and innocent. The relationship **endures the trials** of life’s reality. Wondering will a child be **conceived**. **In spite of the challenges and difficulties the relationship suffers / the troubles facing the world, there is always a ray of hope**. The wish to have an opportunity to **procreate**, to teach. It is an **instinctive drive** among all animals. **The chance to dream of a brighter future is an element of humanity that sometimes needs particular care and attention. For without the cultivation of dreams and some element of hope life can be quite dark at times.**

- endure:  (written) to experience and deal with sth that is painful or unpleasant, especially without complaining. Synonym: BEAR
  [VN] They had to endure a long wait before the case came to trial. ◆ She could not endure the thought of parting. 
- trial: A trial is an experiment in which you test something by using it or doing it for a period of time to see how well it works. If something is on trial, it is being tested in this way. 
  They have been treated with this drug in clinical trials. 
  I took the car out for a trial on the roads.

LME 43 <http://archive.aweber.com/ddm_membership/Bu3F3/h/Lesson_43_Luck_of_the_Irish.htm>

America has a special day coming up. By the name of the day, you might not think it’s American…but trust me! America, especially the younger people (college-age and up) LOVE this day.


This is considered an Irish holiday—relating back to St. Patrick who, among other great things, **is rumored to have gotten rid of ALL the snakes in Ireland.**


But it has been much more popular in the USA than Ireland. Well, more popular NOT because of its **Catholic roots,** but because of a few other reasons:

We can watch a parade!
We can make everything green—that’s Ireland’s national color! We even turn our rivers green~

We can wear GREEN! And don’t forget your **shamrocks!**

- The Shamrock:
  - This is a symbol of Ireland, it is called a Shamrock or a clover
  - It has religious significance as St. Patrick used it to teach people about religion
  - A four leaf Shamrock is called a 4 leaf clover and is supposed to bring luck to whoever finds one.


We DRINK a lot of green beer, Irish whiskey and Guinness!


Yes, it’s a party holiday in the USA—and there will be a LOT of green beer drinking, green shirt wearing Americans **this coming Friday and Saturday…and a few on Sunday**, too!

St. Patrick’s Day is March 17th of every year. You don’t have to be Irish to celebrate it—just be full of happiness and wish everyone the BEST of LUCK!

- May your pockets be heavy and your heart be light,

  May good luck pursue you each morning and night,

  Happy Saint Patrick's!




A quick recap: St. Patrick’s Day, St. Patrick, snakes, parade, green, shamrock, Guinness

Divide and conquer.

- conquer ['kɒŋkə]: If one country or group of people conquers another, they take complete control of their land. 

It's a very effective strategy in WAR and POLITICS.

Divide the soldiers, you weaken them. Divide the people, you weaken them. Then you attack. 

But most of us are NOT fans of war or politics, right? I'm not! 

But still, "divide and conquer" can be useful.

When I want to TEACH something, I use a "divide and conquer" strategy. I do that in DDM and PIRF.

In DDM, I divide English into THREE parts:

Sentence analysis (phrases, idioms, phrasal verbs, grammar)
Pronunciation of Americans (native speakers)
Nuance (culture, history, background information)

- nuance: a subtle difference in meaning or opinion or attitude

In PIRF, I divide English into FOUR parts:

Pronunciation (Perfect American pronunciation)
Intonation (sentence stress)
Rhythm (speed, volume, pauses)
Flow (speaking from "heart" not "head")

I divide my classes...THEN

I have my students ATTACK.

And together...

We CONQUER!



- Hi Coach!

  How are you doing?

  Recently I went with my sister to a beagle get-together! It's an event which takes place every weekend. It helps the dogs  **blow off some steam**. The beagles are super stoked--they run around, play and sometimes argue with each other.

  - blow off: to refuse to take notice of, honor, or deal with : IGNORE <decided to blow off two billion viewers ― Harry Homburg> b : to end a relationship with 
  - steam:  If you run out of steam, you stop doing something because you have no more energy or enthusiasm left. (INFORMAL) 

  After two hours of that madness, they're dead tired!

Me and Glock. My sister also has a cat - Uzi. Glock and Uzi have been raised together since they were little. Glock jumps on furniture (or tries) together with Uzi, and Uzi goes outside for a walk together with Glock.

I tried to talk her into naming them Smith and Wesson, but she didn't agree. Bummer...

Hi Darek! 

Easy--just get two more dogs. Or some combination. Boom! Smith and Wesson!! Also, Glock and Uzi are EXCELLENT names!

I LOVE beagles. My grandpa had one when I was little. I don't remember his name, but it was when I was about 4 years old. Even back then, he was a really old dog. But so sweet!

Did you train Glock? And do Glock and Uzi really take walks together?!! On a leash?!!!



- Hi Shane

  My city of birth is Tlemcen. It is an Algerian city which has been around even long before the Roman conquest in 32 AD. The interesting thing, despite it being in Africa and near the Mediterranean, every year it snows there!

  Unfortunately, I don't have any pictures to share, but I found some recent pictures of the city and the surrounding area on the internet--lots of snow! It’s not your kind of snow, but it's still African snow.

Hi Nour-Eddine! 

WOW!! I NEVER would have guessed that it snowed REGULARLY and A LOT in Algeria. I know it gets cold, I know you might get some snow...but NOT that much! The pictures look very nice! Next time, I hope you share some of your pictures from Algeria and your hometown!

- Hi! Coach Shane!

  I'm a new DDM student--I joined in January and it's amazing! A lot of work and not much time, but I am doing my best to finish all these incredible DDM lessons. Thank you! My goal is to be much better in English. And your lessons AND your daily emails are helping me to learn English as a HABIT. And I know that's SUPER important.

   


Hi Vasily!  

Another **cross country skier!** I can't wait to j**oin you out on the trails**~~ And I'm SUPER happy that you are enjoying DDM. 

If I had had DDM-style classes when I was studying Korean...ugh! I would have learned SO much faster and SO much more! Keep studying hard and when you get a chance, join me in a LIVE class, okay? This week I don't have LIVE classes, but next week I have a full schedule!

- What's up, Coach Shane?

   Above are some Brazilian safety slogans.

  The first means "Good people also kill. If you drive, forget the cell phone."

  The second means "Road safety" "There's always someone waiting for you." 


Hi Joao! 

Two POWERFUL slogans. Thank you for sharing, Joao. I'm sure there are lots more, too. 

SO...everyone else?!! Don't be SHY about sharing photos!!

I really want photos YOU take, but sometimes we can use GOOGLE images, too! (I know, I usually use Google images in my newsletters!!!)

 

- One night I wanted some Ramen. So I made Ramen. It looks much better than it tasted. The seaweed **was past it’s Use By date** but I didn’t get sick.

  Still drawing lines, circles and perspective exercises. I’ll draw a real picture real soon because both you and me have gotten tired of lines and circles I’m sure.

  Back to drawing real things!!! That’s my dog Luka. A 10-second **sketch** before he moved.

Hello Coach Matt,

WOW!! I recognized Luka IMMEDIATELY. That means...you're getting DAMN good! 

Hey, if you want to have really good noodles--you should ask my wife for her secret recipe. It's so good...you might go crazy! Love the updates, Coach Matt! 

 

- Shopping. Mikey is using his new birthday gift for the first time. A **baby-backpack**! Believe me...the kid is getting heavy!

Lunch. This is Angie--she's a neighbor **from up the road.** She joined us on our recent shopping trip. 

She's enjoying a delicious beef hot dog at Costco!

In our current DDM, we are talking about Costco! So, if you're a DDM VIP student and you have some questions about Costco--FIRE AWAY!

We have had SO much snow this winter. **Another FOOT of snow** on Sunday. Tomorrow they say another six inches. I have NO place to put the snow~~ I even **got stuck with my truck while plowing!**! 

Do you see the icicles hanging off the eaves on the top of the picture?! Very nice picture--thank you, honey!

- icicles: a pendent spear of ice formed by the freezing of dripping water
- eave: the lower border of a roof that overhangs the wall ― usually used in plural

I was worrying about the roof on my garage. With so much snow, it might collapse. I'll **keep you updated**~~

I haven't seen Paul in a while. He runs the farm where we get our milk, beef and pork. He's a GREAT farmer who does EVERYTHING by hand. I mean EVERYTHING!

All that firewood there is for his workshop, milk house and **chicken coop**. He's got a wonderful farm. **I would LOVE to one day have such a thing~~**

Daddy's eating **calzones** and Mikey LOVES watching the **stringy cheese!** Mikey is growing a lot of teeth, but he's still not good at chewing. Yet. Maybe in a year he'll be sharing calzones with me!

- stringy: (of meat) full of sinews; especially impossible to chew

Oh, calzones are NEW for me! We learned about them in DDM, too!! You really should join us!

It will CHANGE your LIFE in SO MANY WAYS!

TO LEARN: hood, bonnet, trunk, boot + 10 MORE!

 

In our current DDM lesson (#557), we studied the word HOOD and carburetor. Two common words regarding cars, right?

- Hood
- carburetor

We ALL should know what HOOD means, but carburetor is more technical—you don’t really need to know that word. It’s a part of the engine—if you like cars, though, you should know it!

We talked about this AND many more in the lesson. If you are NOT a member yet, JOIN. I'm having a super special LUCKY sale right now.

Back to HOOD. That’s the metal part that covers the engine, right?


But wait a minute…in the UK, they say something different! They call the hood a **BONNET!** In the US, a bonnet is for a little girl!


It gets crazier.

What’s the “back” of the car called—the place you can open and put a suitcase or maybe find a **spare** tire?

- spare: You use spare to describe something that is not being used by anyone, and is therefore available for someone to use.


In the US, we call it a trunk. But those crazy Brits—they call it a boot! In the US, a boot is something that you put on your foot!


British English and American English have a LOT of differences! Learning them can be fun… BUT it could really cause problems for ESL learners, too. If you ask me, American English is SO much easier AND logical when compared to British English!! But what do you think?


Here’s a small quiz focusing on CARS and driving and streets. You must choose the word that is common in the USA, not the UK! Okay?

https://parmyproductionsllc.app.box.com/s/f3ve9dsnv3olvpcbcwqffiutbhlxqg3l

_______ is always a problem during New Year’s Eve. Don’t do it.
Drink driving         B. **Drunk driving**
I hate driving close to those giant _______. I get scared~
**18-wheelers**           B. juggernauts (A juggernaut is a very large truck. (mainly BRIT) )
I rarely _______ slow drivers anymore. As I get older, I realize that I’m **in no hurry of getting to my final destination!**
**pass**                        B. overtake
Walk through the _______ if you want to get to the other side of that busy street.

**TO LEARN: pi, pie, as American as apple pie, as sweet as pie, a sweetie pie, a finger in every pie, a pie in the sky, shut your pie hole**

Did you know today is a special day? It’s PI day! Not “pie” day, but “pi” day. March 14th…3/14…3.14!! Oh, that math thing related to circles~~

And to celebrate Pi Day…I thought I would introduce some PIE-related idioms! (By the way, “pi” and “pie” are pronounced the same!)

Americans LOVE **pie**, and most people believe that apple pie is an American invention. But that is very doubtful! ANYWAY, we have this expression:

That means that ~ is 100% American!! Typical American!

**Wearing shorts in the wintertime?**

**That’s as American as apple pie!**


Here’s an easy one:

**She’s as sweet as pie! Or She’s a sweetie pie!**

Use that when you want to describe someone or something as perfectly pleasant!!

What about this one:

**He has a finger in every pie~**

We use that idiom when we want to describe someone as doing SO MANY different things. Sometimes we use it as a **compliment**, but we can also use it to **criticize** someone. You have to know the context to know if it’s GOOD or BAD!!

**Everything bad that happens in the USA…it’s Putin’s fault. He has a finger in every American pie!** 

If something is a “**pie in the sky**”…

It’s just a dream. A fantasy.

**Coach Shane’s goal of becoming a basketball star is just a pie in the sky~~**

Let’s finish with a RUDE one! DON’T USE THIS AT WORK!

**Shut your pie hole!!**

That means “shut up”! Your mouth is a hole…it’s a hole where you can put pie! So if someone tells you to shut your pie hole…shut up!!

Which PIE idiom is your favorite?! And just a reminder—I have a **SWEETIE PIE** deal for you! Join both **DDM & PIRF** for an amazing price.

LME 47 <http://archive.aweber.com/ddm_membership/9U5x3/h/Lesson_47_Phrasal_Verbs.htm>

**TO LEARN: sign in, sign out, sign for, sign away, sign off, sign up**

Phrasal Verb Friday is here! It’s also the **Ides of March** (if you’re a Shakespeare fan!!) But NO Shakespeare, today! Let’s master 6 phrasal verbs using SIGN! The first thing I want you to recognize is the verb SIGN!

“to sign” can have several meanings, but the MOST COMMON is “to write your name”.

If we add a preposition—how will that influence sign. Let’s take a look!

**SIGN IN**

If you arrive at a big meeting or at a hotel or are visiting someone who’s in the hospital, you cannot simply enter. You have to first sign in. You have to **write your name** on a list/computer and then you can **go in**—join the meeting/get your room/see the patient.

 **SIGN OUT**

Of course, when you leave a place where you have signed in—you have to sign out! Too easy! But, at the library you can also sign out a book. You show the book to the library, **give them your name** and then **take** the book **out**!

**SIGN FOR**

When the deliveryman comes to your door with a big box for you—he sometimes asks you to **sign for the box**. By **writing your name** on his device, you are accepting **responsibility** **for the box**.

**SIGN AWAY**

When I joined the army many years ago, my mother was very angry. She thought I was signing away my life. She thought I would end up in a war and die and she would never see me again. I was signing my name to a contract and going away forever~ Fortunately, I came back! I love you, mom^^ I **signed my name** to a military contract and **gave away my right** to my life!

**SIGN OFF**

Before I sign off tonight… (**sign my name** at the bottom and **say goodbye** and **turn off** my **computer**!)

**SIGN UP**

…I want to remind you to sign up for our SALE! **Put your name** in our system and you will be subscribed to our class and we will **update** **you** with new **lessons** and hangouts!

A quick recap: **sign in,** **sign out****,** **sign for****,** **sign away****,** **sign off****,** **sign up**

**TO LEARN: Dr. Seuss, a pen name, nom de plume**

It’s Americana Monday. If you want to learn American English—you HAVE TO learn about the culture and history of the USA, too.

In PIRF lesson 199 [*(our speaking class)*](https://www.letsmasterenglish.com/signup/pirf/), we talked about the state of Massachusetts. In Massachusetts, we learned a little about the **Dr. Seuss** museum.

Dr. Seuss is a man who wrote MANY children’s books. He is responsible for making MILLIONS of American children fall in love with reading!

Actually, he wasn’t a real doctor and Seuss was his middle name. But many authors use **a pen name** (*nom de plume* [French—but we use that word in America, too]—an adopted name used by authors), right?!

Dr. Seuss wrote books that children loved for several reasons. Among them…

- They are fun to read. A funny style of poetry.
- They are fun to look at. They have great illustrations.
- The characters are funny and do silly things.
- Many of the characters are NOT humans.

There are more reasons, too. But I think those four reasons are BIG! And some of Dr. Seuss’s BIGGEST books were:

I read them all. But—if I had to choose THREE?

I would definitely choose…actually, I already chose it!


Many of these books have been translated into other languages.

But I wonder how well they can translate simple children’s rhymes into another language effectively…

Have you ever read a Dr. Seuss book? In your language? Did you like it? Was it your book or your child’s? Are they popular in your country? Send me a picture!

 I’ll finish today’s lesson with my own Dr. Seuss-styled poem.

**English can be fun.**

**English can be nice.**

**English can be easy**

**If you follow my advice~**

A quick recap: **Dr. Seuss,** **a pen name****,** **nom de plume**

Even after spending the month of January in Jinan, winter was slow to vacate the Poconos. Late season cold temperatures dipping below zero (Fahrenheit) and [March that “came in like a lion](https://www.farmersalmanac.com/the-truth-behind-in-like-a-lion-out-like-a-lamb-2867)“, these were weather issues I did not want to deal with. I maintained a steady course of exercise by going to the gym and doing stretching. On alternate days I continued with floor exercises using the large bands for resistance training and building my core. Feeling stronger each week, I could feel the stability return to my center and especially my hip. It’s now 8 months past my surgery and I feel pretty good.

- vacate: If you vacate a place or a job, you leave it or give it up, making it available for other people. (FORMAL)

  He recently vacated his post as NHS Personnel Director. 

A special treat in the night sky this week; As the [Vernal Equinox ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox)arrives **signaling the official start of spring,** we will experience not only a Full Moon, but it will be a “[Super Moon](https://earthsky.org/human-world/what-is-a-supermoon)” too!

Whatever you do, just remember that each one of us has a limited time here on this **mortal plane.** There are only so many full moons, not to mention Super Moons, and **celestial events** we may have opportunity to witness during our lives. **Better get out and enjoy your life, because before you know it the clock runs out and the game is over.**

- mortal: that cannot live for ever and must die: We are all mortal.

- celestial: 

  - Celestial is used to describe things relating to heaven or to the sky. (LITERARY) 
    ...the clusters of celestial bodies in the ever-expanding universe...

  -  If you describe something as celestial, you mean that it is wonderful. 
    ...a chocolate cake with an apricot filling and celestial effect on the taste buds.

Don't give up. 
Just take a break. 

Vacations from something are often TOO long! After a vacation from work--sometimes we feel even MORE tired! But an afternoon off...three- or four-day weekend! Paradise. 

But we want more!! But too much is NO good!! Balance~

Just like when you study English. **Taking some time off** is GOOD. It gives your brain a chance to rest. 

But it also makes your brain stronger so when you come back, you're really good! But too long off...it feels like you go back to ZERO!!

Balance. Take a break. Enjoy YOUR life.

Then get back to the grind (work!). When is your next break? For how long? What will you do? Let me know and share some pictures!

- grind: boring activity. (informal) an activity that is tiring or boring and takes a lot of time: the daily grind of family life ◆ It's a long grind to the top of that particular profession.

Hi Coach Shane,

 

Last year my wife Sandra and I celebrated St. Patrick’s Day in Prague, **Czech**. We drank **Guinness,** green Beer and wore green clothes. It was a very nice evening and I almost forgot about it. Thank you for reminding me of that funny day.

- Czech: Czech means belonging or relating to the Czech Republic, or to its people, language, or culture. 

Hi Hardy!  

Excellent pictures!! You two look so happy! I've heard the Czech beer is really good. Is it better than German beer? And what about Guinness--did you like it? It's quite different, isn't it? I hope that **I can make it to Europe one day**. If I go, I can't wait to try the beers and sausages!! Perhaps we can share a beer together!



- As you know, Coach, I am a Pilates and Yoga teacher. 
  - Pilates: /'pailət/

In these photos, you can see my Pilates class. And below is my cat Emily. She studies English with me every day but she doesn't like to speak at all.

Emily is really curious and sometimes she gets in trouble because of that. Have a nice weekend

Hi Graziella! 

Wow! You've got a full house of students! I must **confess**, Graziella, I tried yoga for a little bit...

 It was MUCH harder than I thought it would be.

 I wish I could find a good instructor on YouTube or something. Something for old guys like me. Not too tough. Slow. Easy. Any recommendations?!

What about your **hubby?** Does he practice yoga?

 Emily looks adorable! If she gets into serious trouble, tell her to speak only in English and the police might let her go because she's a silly American!



- In a buffet restaurant, my wife’s sister, her son and daughter.
  All of our birthdays are in March, so we celebrate them together in **a lump-birthday party** (ｰ ｰ;)
  Oops! My nieces’s birthday is in July. But no problem.

  I changed her diapers 30 years ago. We’re family.
  We enjoyed Chinese, Italian, Japanese, and Greek dishes along with some desserts. Moussaka was very good ! 

This is a soft serve ice cream server. I love ice cream. You can eat this as much as you want.  And I ice creamed out.(>_>)

The next day my wife made traditional Japanese dishes for me.

They were very easy on my stomach and all very healthy.

① Rice with grated yam paste topped with “Nori” seaweed flakes (the green stuff)

② Grated salmon pickled in *sake lees*

③ Natto (99% of American dislike this. I eat every day.)  with grated radish

④ Steamed cabbage with Ponzu sauce （made of soy sauce with citrus juice）

⑤ Oriental pickling melon pickled in *sake lees*

⑥ Grated radish

⑦ Soy sauce

Country Hajime (Japan Aomori pref. Hirakawa City) 

( ^_^)/~~~

ALL of you in MARCH? Wow!! Christmas time in the country is a special time for moms and dads!!!

The food at the buffet sounds great. But, to be honest...I'm a country guy, too. And HOME-COOKED meals are just the best, right? Those traditional Japanese dishes sound really, really good. You and I are blessed to have such good cooks in the house! It must be our **country appeal**!

 I have never heard of "sake lees" so I spent a lot of time on Google to figure it out. I fully understand it now. I will look forward to sampling some of this food soon. Just as I want to go to Europe to eat, I want to go to Japan to eat, too! And drink! Together? Let's do it!

- Avocados. They're as big as my head! And they're SUPER delicious!  I picked these from the tree in my yard!


Hi Coach Paul, As big as your head? Really? WOW!!

 Avocados are TOO expensive here in the USA. At least where I live in the country~ And they're SO nutritious. I buy one occasionally. I wish I could buy more. Actually, I wish we could have an avocado tree in the yard. But it's too dang cold! SEND ME A BOX!!

- Using my kid as a grocery basket. Two lemons in his hood. Mikey's first job is as a SHOPPING CART!!!!

Mystery animal! My neighbor said it could be a bear! But I'm thinking a **raccoon**. Do you have any expertise **in animal tracks**. Can you guess what that is? Help us out!!

The snow is STARTING to melt. We are going to have a LAKE in our driveway. It's going to be terrible. I'm talking with the neighbor. She lives up on a hill, so drainage (water run-off from snow melting) is not a problem. It will be for us. Not our house, but a problem for the driveway and garage~ Ugh!

I'm spring cleaning. Cleaning out the garage. I have to make sure things are NOT going to get too wet. Over the next month or two, I will have a lot of melting snow and the garage will take on some water. I have a radio **blasting** in the background. Foreigner is singing their great song called Jukebox Hero! I love that song. Do you know it?

I could use your help. Mikey is still too little to work. Maybe next year, right? He'll be two. Two is old enough to start working, right? Maybe I should tell my wife to have one more child. If we have one more, do you think we'd have a boy or a girl? Should I have another kid? Hmm...questions, questions, questions!

**TO LEARN: Why doing dictation might help your English.**

 Have you been to my [**Daily Dictation channel on YouTube**](https://www.youtube.com/user/dailydictation/)? It’s the perfect channel for you to test your listening ability. Some lessons are easy—others are really tough! But they are ALL short. 5-20 seconds. Super short!

I started having my students do dictation many years ago. It’s a “game” to see how good your listening skills are.

**If your understanding of a situation is perfect**, **you should be able to write down what was said**, right? But **THAT** is the problem! Students feel confident in their listening ability. They feel that they understand the situation.

**But dictation is TOUGH!**

The words…the grammar…the idioms…the nuance!

The same thing happened to me in Korea. I could watch a TV drama and have a VERY good understanding of what was happening…but I couldn’t even write ONE sentence of the dialogue perfectly.

So, I started dictating. I would have Korean friends check and show me my mistakes.

What happened?

I started **NATURALLY** learning grammar and learning vocabulary and learning idioms!

And because I was **watching TV** dramas—I could see the body language and really **catch the speaking tone**—I learned about **nuance**!

Nuance, everyone, is KEY for advanced level students. Nuance—being able to “read between the lines”. Being able to understand the “unspoken meaning” of words and phrases and body language!

All of that helped me master Korean in a very short period of time.

After 25 years in Korea, I was STILL learning something every day. But when you get to the advanced level in any language—THEN you realize how much you don’t know!

> The more I learn, the more I realize I don't know
>
> - Albert Einstein

**Doing dictation** forces you to SLOW DOWN. It forces you to analyze your mistakes. It teaches you how native English speakers speak. It forces you to THINK TWICE about grammar and structure. It shows you words and phrases that seem illogical—unless you have a coach!

Doing dictation is a very good path to English mastery. Any language, actually.

I encourage you all to try my Daily Dictation channel. I just uploaded our [399th Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ksu1m4pb-aA)! It’s pretty easy~ [DD 398](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMHBhNnswxw) was TOUGH!

If you like those lessons, then you should [join my DDM classes](https://www.letsmasterenglish.com/signup/ddm/).

They’re the BEST classes for intermediate and advanced students. Why study boring stuff when you can study the best stuff PLUS it’s **never boring**?!

TO LEARN: off the beaten path, ~ galore**

Hi ,

Our new PIRF assignment #202 (our speaking class) has so many excellent phrases, idioms and phrasal verbs that Americans use all the time. And what’s really cool—every month we study about a different state. So far, we’ve studied about **Vermont and Massachusetts—and this month we’re studying Montana.** ([you really should join PIRF!](https://www.letsmasterenglish.com/signup/pirf/)).

Anyway, here are two excellent phrases from our current lesson—my gift to ALL of you!

If something is **off the beaten path**, it means it is **located in an area that** **most people don’t go** OR **don’t know about**.

My home is off the beaten path. *(it’s located in a place where FEW people ever go)*

When I travel, I like to go off the beaten path. *(I like to go to places where few tourists ever go)*

The restaurant is off the beaten path. *(the restaurant is located far from other restaurants)*

**Rock paintings galore**

- You use galore to emphasize that something you like exists in very large quantities. (INFORMAL, WRITTEN) 
  You'll be able to win prizes galore. 
  ...a popular resort with beaches galore and a large marina. 

I really like this expression. It means there are **an ENORMOUS AMOUNT of whatever** you’re talking about. In the phrase above, LOTS and LOTS of rock paintings!

In my backyard, we have deer galore. *(we have a HUGE number of deer visiting my backyard every day)*

In my refrigerator there is beer galore! *(I have MANY cans and bottles of beer in my refrigerator. Would you like one?!)*

I have lessons galore! *(I have SO MANY lessons—come and join me, you will never be bored!)*

 

Tomorrow is Friday! I have FOUR LIVE classes tomorrow and a new DDM Lesson video to make—very busy! But busy is good! Oh, and tomorrow is Phrasal Verb Friday—so a new lesson for you, too!

 

A quick recap: **off the beaten path****,** **~ galore**
