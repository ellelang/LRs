<Another year gone….>[http://english-speak-english.com/another-year-gone/]

On this last day of the year it can be instructive to take stock of what’s happening around the world. While many of us may live in relative peace and comfort, there are many people who do not. Given the current state of global affairs, I expect 2019 to be a pretty wild ride. The following are presented in no particular order of importance.

- be instructive
- live in relative peace and comfort

- take stock of what's happening ... = examine, see, list

Here’s a link to take a reading of some important points in the socio-political landscape of America.

- here's a link to take a reading of some important points in ..

It’s bad enough the the United States has allowed upwards of 20 million illegal aliens into the country, but this link shares details from FBI statistics that indicate roughly 8 million of those here illegally attempted to buy guns…illegally! To those politicians who assert the answer is “we need better gun control laws”, I say fuck-off and die! We need effective enforcement of border security. Limiting the rights of law-abiding citizens will do nothing to make us safer. Neither will it limit criminals from accessing firearms.



- it's bad enough that the ....
- upwards of : more than : in excess of <they cost upwards of $25>
- indicate 
- roughly
- To those ... who assert the answer  is "...", I say ...
- effective enforcement of 
- Doing sth. will do nothing to ..... Neither will it  do sth...



Democrats in congress seem to be more interested in blaming Russia for anything that ails the U.S.A., than fixing the problems under their noses. Now that their party has taken a majority in the House of (non) Representatives, it seems Trump may have his hands tied in terms of getting any further policy changes passed. Additionally, tension between Russia and the U.S. over the events in Ukraine has a chance of kicking off a nasty conflict between these two old rivals…..With respect to American or, any Western European country, I have to ask, what strategic interest / value does Ukraine hold? The “Deep State” wants more war….for more peace, of course.

- ail: If something ails a group or area of activity, it is a problem or source of trouble for that group or for people involved in that activity. 

  Blaming Russia for anything that ails the U.S.A.

The rot in higher education continued in 2018. Here are the Top-10 Most Outrageous Stories for the year.

  *The country's leaders are unwilling to take unpopular measures to stop the rot.* 

- outrageous:  If you describe something as outrageous, you are emphasizing that it is unacceptable or very shocking.



This link gives a snapshot look at the financial markets for the final day of trading in 2018. After pulling back in the earlier part of the year, gold has regained some of it’s luster currently trading at $1,282.  Oddly, silver remains lagging at $15.46. Perhaps it’s a good time to buy a little silver, while the price is still relatively low.



- give a snapshot look at ... 

- pull back  : If someone pulls back from an action, they decide not to do it or continue with it, because it could have bad consequences. 

- luster:  a superficial attractiveness or appearance of excellence . Gold has regained some of it's luster currently trading at  $1,282.

All over South America there are troubles; Argentina is mired in corruption. Brazil endures post-election problems, Chile is among many nations that continue to grapple with the world-wide problem of pedophile priests. Columbia continues to address their violent crime problems. Peru’s President Moreno deals with problems his administration inherited. Venezuela is the latest shining example of the failures of Socialism.

The Euro-project seems in more peril than ever, as the ‘Yellow-vests”, or Gilets Juanes…..as they are called in France, not satisfied with Macron’s concessions, continue to riot. He is perceived by the populous as being an elitist / Globalist and out-of-touch with the people. These protests are not isolated to Paris. They are widespread across the nation of France and give no indication of abetting anytime soon. So pervasive are these protests that the French government has considered declaring a national emergency. And all across the Euro-zone the migration issues is causing big problems. I suspect that Europe passed the point of being able to peacefully recover her social, historical and religious identity. They let the barbarians inside the gate.

- peril: exposure to the risk of being injured, destroyed, or lost : DANGER .   e.g. fire put the city in peril> 

  Euro-project seems in more peril than ever.

- barbarians: In former times, barbarians were people from other countries who were thought to be uncivilized and violent. 
  The Roman Empire was overrun by Nordic barbarians

- let the barbarians inside the gate.



Also, on the other side of the pond, Brexit seems in peril. It appears that Italy is going through what Greece experienced not too long ago, with respect to the ongoing economic issues between their country and the European Central Committee. Many Germans have had enough of the Merkel regime, thus she has declined to seek reelection, but not before she declared that “nation-states should give up some of their sovereignty“. Here is a report that cites impending changes to the German economy. The Irish Times files this report on some more of the unsettling events of the past twelve months.

- sb is going though...., with respect to the ongoing ... issues....

- Many Germans have had enough of the Merkel regime, thus...

Meanwhile, President Trump addressed the United Nations and informed that “the U.S. rejects the ideology of Globalism“. He may need to inform the other half of the country who are apparently a-okay with the notion of world governance. As well, leaders of the Visegrad nations (Hungary, Czech Republic, Austria, Poland and Slovakia) have formally and firmly asserted their rejection of Communism and the Euro-Central Committee’s demands to import massive numbers of Mohammedans from Africa and elsewhere. I’m glad that some leaders on the international stage have not lost all ability to exercise reason and logic.

- address sb = give speech to sb

- reject the ideology of ..

- who *are apparently **a-okay with** the notion* of world governance.

Religious freedom suffers another setback in Turkey. How is Turkey an ally of Western governments? Another ally of the U.S. government and long time recipient of U.S. military hardware, Saudi Arabia, had beheaded a total of 48 people in the first four months of this year. It’s hard to keep up with death counts of these barbaric regimes, but when beheadings aren’t good enough, these savages have used crucifixion in a pinch. Most of these “criminals” were non-violent offenders. Why is the United States allied with such backward and brutal thugs? What is the difference between the Saudis and the Iranians?

- suffer another setback in sth. 
  A setback is an event that delays your progress or reverses some of the progress that you have made. 

- an ally of western government

- savages = barbarians
- crucifixion = extreme and painful punishment, affliction, or suffering

I’m not particularly enamored with author Andrew Sullivan, but I think he is right about the Neo-Conservative response to Trumps plan for getting U.S. troops out of Syria and Afghanistan. The Establishment Will Never Say No to a War. This link makes the argument that Syria Was Never a Just War. …..So why are we there?



- enamored with sb =   feel a strong or excessive interest or fascination 
- Establishment <in capitalized : a controlling group 
- the link makes the argument that ...



As of December 22, the most recent outbreak of the Ebola virus, in Democratic Republic of Congo has taken the lives of 692 (known) souls. Record keeping is not the best in that part of the world, so the numbers of possibly infected people is basically a guess….and it could be much, much higher. Don’t eat bush-meat and run the other way if you see an African with symptoms of hemorrhagic fever coming your way! The communists under Cyril Ramaphosa continue to steal land, foment injustice and murder white land-owners in South Africa….and not much word of it in the news.

- As of Dec.22, the most recent

- continue to hold the title of ...when it comes to sth...
- talks seem to have stalled.  stall: a ruse to deceive or delay



From Japan comes this headline that speaks volumes about the idiocy of their current crop of leaders; Japanese cybersecurity minister admits he has never used a computer! You simply can not make this stuff up! Let us also not forget about Fukushima. It’s been seven years since the nuclear disaster that occurred at that power plant and radioactive waste continues to pour into the Pacific Ocean.



- speak volumes about : to provide a lot of information about something 

- idiocy of : something notably stupid or foolish

-  cybersecurity

- You simply can not make this stuff up = you have to believe it is true.

   make something up. —. to say or write something that is not true: I made up an excuse because I didn't want to go. 

- Let us also not forget about Fukushima
- radioactive waste continues to pour into the Pacific Ocean.



Further south in the Pacific, Java, near the Krakatoa Volcano that erupted recently, has resulted in the deaths of more than 400 hundred with many more still unaccounted for. Living on an island gives one little choice of avoiding the effects of periodic seismic shifts, volcanoes and tsunamis.

- with many still unaccounted for. 
-  avoiding the effects of periodic seismic shifts, volcanoes and tsunamis.



All I can say is, pray for peace and for justice for the oppressed. Be thankful for all you have. Keep your friends and family close. Let them know you love them. Hope for the best in the coming year and buy more ammo.

- oppressed: people who re oppressed are treated cruelly or are prevented from having the same opportunities, freedom, and benefits as others. 
  Before they took power, they felt oppressed by the white English speakers who controlled things. 

- ammo: Ammo is ammunition for guns and other weapons. (INFORMAL)

- My hugs to your family

Yes--the real meaning of Christmas, is remembering those in need and doing something for them. Sending children cards and gifts is a really wonderful thing to do.

- pedestrian mall

Wow--in the US, Santa flies around in a sleigh.  I wish you and your wife a SUPER 2019 with great health and success!

- sparse : Something that is sparse is small in number or amount and spread out over an area.  / of few and scattered elements especially : not thickly grown or settled

  A cymbal is a flat circular brass object that is used as a musical instrument. You hit it with a stick or hit two cymbals together, making a loud noise. 

- Ladybugs  that move~
- A tin soldier that bangs on a drum!

And…all of those toys were **WIND-UP** toys! On the side or on the back of the toy, there was a handle or a little pin that you “wind” and then the toy will “play”!

With the new year, many people want to make a new plan. A fresh start. Why not? It’s a great time to do something new, right?! But instead of DOING something…what about FINDING something?

Below is a list of “things” that people spend YEARS looking for. Some people never find them. What about you? I still have a LOT of “things” to find, but I think I have found a few! You can see them in blue.

FIND YOUR...

- Have you found your bliss? Your happiness

- Find your calling—the job that feels natural to you

  -  YES! For me, teaching!

- Find your destiny—God’s purpose for you OR your life according to the stars (astrology)

- Find your edge—your advantage that other people don’t have

  - Yes! I think~ The ability to explain difficult things EASILY to people

- Find your fate—your destiny

- Find your grind—the work (job) that is best for you

  - Yes! Working for myself online at home!

  - grind : dreary, monotonous, or difficult labor, study, or routine b : one who works or studies excessively* 

- Find your groove—*the lifestyle that is perfect for you*. 
  - Yes! The country life—like a farmer with a computer!
  - groove: a fixed routine : RUT b : a situation suited to one's abilities or interests : NICHE 

​      

- Find your passion—something you LOVE doing

- Find your purpose—your reason for living
  - Yes, I think. To help people by making them smile~

- Find your spirit animal—the animal you resemble in your daily life

- Find your style—the “look” (appearance) that is best for you

- Find your talent—a skill that you’re naturally good at
- Find your voice—the ability to express your thoughts and feelings easily
- Find your way—the path towards a happy/successful life
- Find your Zen—an inner peace where you are able to block out the rest of the world!

That’s it for today…**a little philosophical!!**

LME Lesson 4 <http://archive.aweber.com/ddm_membership/HYHUZ/h/English_Lesson_4_Enjoy_it.htm>

**TO LEARN: reddit, lurk, nootropics, subreddit,  AMA**

I highly recommend you check out reddit FOR YOUR ENGLISH!

Reddit.com is the 16th most popular website in the WORLD! Reddit is a place where you can find every type of subject and talk about it with other people. **Or you can “lurk”. To lurk means to “just watch”!!**

I go to reddit to find out information about “nootropics”. Nootropics are vitamins and foods and herbs that I can eat which help my BRAIN function better! Another “subreddit’ (subject in reddit) that I like is ELI5.ELI5 is short for “ExplainLikeImFive” or “Explain (difficult subject) as though I’m a five-year-old child”!!

In the ELI5 subreddit, people ask questions about science (LOTS of science), politics, religion or ANY kind of silly question that we don’t understand the answer to.

 That brings me to AMA. AMAs started on reddit—AMA stands for “Ask Me Anything”! Experts and politicians and **celebrities use AMAs to help people, to get to know people, and to satisfy people’s curiosities!**

Nowadays you can find AMAs on Twitter, Facebook, Periscope…**pretty much everywhere on the internet**!

That’s it for today! **A quick recap**: reddit…lurk…nootropics…subreddit…AMA

- A quick recap: 

- Have a super weekend!


**Book review about  [The Minimalist Home: A Room-by-Room Guide to a Decluttered, Refocused Life]**

This is an excellent book--logical, sensible, and worth reading. The one thing missing is "how" to get rid of things. Certain items, like used clothing, are covered, but the problem comes with family heirlooms you no longer want (and no one else does, either) or things, like valuable silver, that you can't just put in the trash. I've tried auctioneers (they don't want to deal with these things any more than you do), consignment shops (they tell me to come and get them), and there they are again, back in my house. What we need next is a book that really focuses on places to send things, not necessarily for monetary gain, but to ensure they don't end up in a landfill. My late mother-in-law used to say that you spend the first half of your life acquiring things and the next half trying to get rid of them. She was right. You can't just toss a two-hundred year old fish slice. So where do you send it?

- family heirlooms 
  An heirloom is an ornament or other object that has  belonged to a family for a very long time and that has been handed down from one  generation to another.

- consignment  shops: a dealer who pays only for what is  sold and who may return what is unsold <goods shipped on consignment*>

- landfill: A landfill is a large deep hole in which very large amounts of rubbish are buried

- you spend the first half of your life acquiring things and the next half trying to get rid of them

- You can't just toss a two-hundred year old fish slice. 

- tackle my mental and physical materialistic issues: 

  If you tackle a difficult problem or task, you deal with it in a very determined or efficient way. 



First off let me say I love Joshua Becker...have been following him for years. I have his first book and thoroughly loved it so was looking forward to this new book. Boy I was disappointed. The book is described as “a room by room guide to a decluttered refocused life.” Nothing could be further from the truth...every chapter(room) said the same thing-get rid of what you don’t want, keep what you love. Not very inspiring! If you preordered the book and are on Joshua's email list, you also received some online materials(minimizing checklist and a step by step minimizing checklist) I found those to be way more helpful, informative, and inspiring than the book itself. In fact I printed them out and put them in protective sheets in a folder so I can refer to them over and over. In those checklists he lists actual ITEMS to declutter and is much more specific as to how to proceed with your decluttering. I still think Joshua’s methods of decluttering and simplifying are the best-this book just fell short.

- refer to them over and over
- how to proceed with your decluttering. 



Many thanks to NetGalley, Waterbrook and Multnomah, and Joshua Becker for an ARC in exchange for an honest review. My opinions are 100% my own and independent of receiving an advanced copy.

Joshua Becker has been in the “minimal” business for about 10 years. He has a website where you can get lots of tips and advice, including a newsletter sent to your inbox every so often. He has written other books but this one is sort of the culmination of his life’s work. He has been on TV, speaks all over and I have been following him for the past couple of years.

- every so often: once in a while; occasionally

- this one is sort of the culmination of his life’s work.


 In today’s **world of massive consumerism**, we can all use a dose of paring down and keeping things simple. We all have too much stuff. **We are promoted, advertised, propagandized into thinking that it’s all stuff we need, what we have isn’t the right stuff and that the more stuff we have the happier we will be.** This has been going on for years, I mean George Carlin had a bit about “Stuff” in the early 80’s. So I was excited to read what Becker had to say on what he promotes as a step by step, comprehensive room-by-room guide to decluttering your home and your life.



- massive consumerism
- pare down:   to trim off an outside, excess, or irregular part. Pare down expenses
- be promoted, advertised, propagandized into thinking that.... 

Ugh - what an awful read. First I felt like his tone was so condescending. I couldn’t take it. Obviously I have a lot of stuff - that’s why I’m reading this book. He would repeat himself, ad nauseam, throughout the whole book. 

- his tone was so condescending. I couldn't take it.

- ad nauseam:  to a sickening or excessive degree


There wasn’t any comprehensive guide - again, he would repeat the same thing over and over for each room, literally the same steps - for each room! Why bother going through each room, listing all of the possible things you might have accumulated, telling me “get rid of what you don’t use or don’t need”. Obviously I knew that much! I don’t need a book for that. I was hoping for some insight, maybe some ideas that I hadn’t thought of to help declutter, some instructions. There was no real guidance other than “don’t do it” for lasting change. 

- there was no sth. other than ...



Then, don’t tell me how my life is going to change, I will become richer, have a fabulous job, help the poor, have more time, blah blah blah, just because you told me to get rid of some stuff. I didn’t buy any of it. I have decluttered before and none of those things have happened to me. The “real life” examples were ridiculous, laughable. Look, I believe in keeping a home without a lot of junk. Nobody needs piles of clothes, lots of knick-knacks, and yes, you should keep those things that mean something to you. 

- I didn't buy any of it.

- knick-knacks:  small objects which people keep as ornaments or toys, rather than for a particular use. 
  e.g. Her flat is spilling over with knick-knacks. 

You shouldn’t get sucked into marketing ideas of having the latest, greatest and best thing out there, which will go out of date and then you need something new. I also happen to live with a (mild case) hoarder, who believes every rock, piece of junk, paper, etc. is extremely important and sentimental and will not throw out anything. 

- get sucked into marketing ideas of ...
- out there 
- (mild case) 
- hoarder: a person loving accumulating items. 
- Sentimental means relating to or involving feelings such as pity or love, especially for things in the past. 
  e.g. Our paintings and photographs are of sentimental value only. 
  e.g. Perhaps he has returned for sentimental reasons. 



So according to Becker, those are the things to keep. Not helpful. But without something new or real to add to the discussion, don’t fill up a book with one idea. My advice is don’t add one more book to your bookshelf with this one.

- fill up: make full

  If you fill up or fill yourself up with food, you eat so much that you do not feel hungry

Beginning this year (2019) I will try and post a monthly topic of “special difficulties” in the English language. Words and phrases that are often confused or misused will be the primary focus, **but there may be other pointers that come up too.**

These words and phrases are worth saving in your vocabulary notebook for future reference.

Words often confused or misused.

Lesson 1

A) Phrases with the word **way**.

**In the way:** Please move this chair. It’s in the way. Do your work in the way I have shown you.

**On the way**: I bought a magazine on the way to the station.

**In this way:** He saves old envelopes. In this way, he has collected a great many stamps.

**By the way**: By the way, have you seen Sally?

**In a way:** In a way, It is an important film.  (to some degree)

The delivery man knocked at my door and he rang the doorbell.
I **knocked the vase off the table** and broke it.
He always **knocks off** at six o’clock on Fridays. (He finishes his work.)
The shop manager **knocked 10% off** the bill. (Reduced the price by 10%.)
A car knocked the boy over.. (It hit him and made him fall.)
The older boxer **knocked out** the younger fighter in the first round. (Hit him so hard that he caused the fighter to lose consciousness.)

- vase:  A vase is a jar, usually made of glass or pottery, used for holding cut flowers or as an ornament.

- Get ready for some serious wet weather coming your way!

[Forget El Nino, StormFest Is about To Hit The West Coast] <https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-01-04/forget-el-nino-stormfest-about-hit-west-coast>

Via Cliff Mass Weather & Climate blog,

Things often calm down after January 1 during El Nino years... but not this year... with the U.S. West Coast from central California to Washington State about to be pummeled by a series of storms.   Rain, snow, wind?  Plenty for everyone.

-  pummeled

A view of the latest infrared satellite imagery shows an amazing line-up of one storm after another stretching way into the Pacific.  A traffic jam of storms.

- infrared infrared  
  Infrared radiation is similar to light but has a longer wavelength, so we cannot see it without special equipment

- line-up
- a traffic jam of storms

**Wind?**  You bet.  Each of these storms will bring strong, damaging winds to a favored area of the coastal zone and mountain peaks. 

There is a **silver lining** of all this action of course:  it will provide an immense amount of water to fill our reservoirs and enhance our snowpack, a **snowpack** that is now in pretty decent shape (see latest summary below).  Water resources should be fine next summer.

- Silver lining: If you talk about a silver lining, you are talking about something positive that comes out of a sad or unpleasant situation. 
  The fall in inflation is the silver lining of the prolonged recession. 
  N-SING
- in a decent shape

But all these facts on the ground and favorable forecasts don't stop some of Seattle's wacky local media from talking about drought for our region, with the Seattle Stranger being one of the worst (see below). 

- wacky:  absurdly or amusingly eccentric or irrational : CRAZY <e.g wacky ideas> <e.g. a wacky comedian> 

Facts should matter---apparently not at the Stranger.

- hedge : a calculatedly noncommittal or evasive statement

My BAD LUCK STREAK (long period of time of continuous bad luck) was caused by BAD DECISIONS that I made.

- streak:  An unbroken series, as of wins or losses

But my BAD LUCK STREAK started to end, also, because of GOOD DECISIONS that I made.

LME 10

It was a SUPER busy week for me with 11 LIVE classes on top of my regular schedule. UGH!!! So, I needed a day off!

I was talking to my neighbor this morning, and she said something really interesting. She said:

> We had guests over on Saturday and then so many visitors on Sunday.

 

After hearing that, I thought—what an excellent idea for a short email lesson!!

Guests VERSUS visitors

Actually, in daily English, many Americans sometimes use them the same. BUT, there is a simple difference

Guests—YOU invited!

Visitors—you did NOT invite!!

When I lived in Las Vegas, I would “**pay my mother a visit**” almost every day. Just for a few minutes. I never called her, I just went to her house.

Houseguests *(you can spell it as one word OR as two)* are guests that stay overnight. Sometimes it’s just one night…but sometimes it’s for several nights!

SMO : https://www.rohitbhargava.com/2006/08/5_rules_of_soci.html

What is Social Media Optimization?
Obviously, SMO has to do with social networks and their growing importance to business. This aspect of optimization deals with enhancing your company’s presence and online reputation through interactive communities—not just Facebook and Twitter, but also blogs, forums, and anywhere your business is mentioned or linked to socially.

Working with SMO can help you strengthen your brand and boost visibility, as well as generate leads and increase sales. Optimizing your social media builds both familiarity with and trust for your business, because consumers will see you not only mentioned, but recommended by others.

- mashup: 

- bogged down 
  If you get bogged down in something, it prevents you from making progress or getting something done. 
  But why get bogged down in legal details?. 
  Sometimes this fact is obscured because churches get so bogged down by unimportant rules.

A bog is an area of land which is very wet and muddy. 

bog as a verb: to cause to sink into or as if into a bog : IMPEDE, MIRE ― usually used with down 
intransitive verb : to become impeded or stuck ― usually used with down

- at 2ish

  It means "around that time". 7-ish just means show up around 7

- fine-tune


If  you fine-tune something, you make very small and precise changes to it in order  to make it as successful or effective as it possibly can be. 
We do not try  to fine-tune the economy on the basis of short-term predictions. 
Computers  allow the plans to be fine-tuned and to be altered quickly. 
VB 

- darn 
  You can say darn it to show that you are very annoyed about 
  something. (AM, INFORMAL) 
  OK, I admit it, it was me. But darn it, I was 
  right!

- committed: did, performed
- authorities: the police...(could also mean government officials)
- armed robbery : robbing a person/business with a weapon
- Much-publicized: highly advertised
- Work out: succeed, come to fruition

VB  

recuperate  : When you recuperate, you recover your health or strength after you have been ill or injured. 
I went away to the country to recuperate. 
He is recuperating from a serious back injury. = recover =>recuperation 
Leonard was very pleased with his powers of recuperation.

LME 11http://archive.aweber.com/ddm_membership/7kX1J/h/Better_LATE_than_NEVER_So.htm

STARTING something...is actually really easy.

BUT maintaining something...not so easy.

And finishing something...even more difficult.

We are now into our second week of 2019. How are you doing? Are you maintaining your goals?!

Did you forget to start?!!

It is NEVER to late to start. But don't delay too long.

What is EASIER than STARTING?

DELAYING!!

Remember, the longer you delay, the more difficult it is to start. And if you never start...


You'll never be better.

Better LATE than NEVER.

Start today. Maintain. Go to the finish!



The man in the picture is a priest at the “Hoshoku Shrine”. It's NOT me!! 

Every year we ask him to come over to my house. He purifies our home to ward off bad luck like natural disasters.

- shrine

A shrine is a place that people visit and treat with respect because it is connected with a dead person or with dead people that they want to remember.

- ward off:  To ward off a danger or illness means to prevent it from affecting you or harming you

There’re lots of offerings to the deity of the Hoshoku Shrine on the table: veggies ＆ rice for a huge harvest, dried squid & grilled dried fish to bring good luck.

- A deity is a god or goddess. (FORMAL)

This is the room where the family Buddhist altar is placed.



- altar  1.altar altars  An altar is a holy table in a church or temple. 
  ...the high altar at Chichester Cathedral 
- .folly follies 
  If you say that a particular action or way of behaving is folly or a folly, you mean that it is foolish. 
  It's sheer folly to build nuclear power stations in a country that has dozens of earthquakes every year. 

Can you see the little portable shrine (upper left)? In that shrine, three deities are enshrined: the goddess of the sun, a food-related deity & this area’s protective deity. 

- enshrined:   to enclose in or as if in a shrine 
  2 : to preserve or cherish as sacred : Her memory is ~d in his heart.

We have lots of deities in Japan.

 Thank you for giving me a shout-out on the LME radio show. I’m very grateful to learn a deeper meaning of the lyrics.

- shout out : a brief expression of greeting or praise given especially on a broadcast or audio recording

Snow has come. Gas mileage is getting worse~ In the car “Shape of my Heart” is playing. It's not so cold outside, minus two degrees Celsius. (^_-)

Lesson 12: Nostalgic Containers?! Yes...what do you think?http://archive.aweber.com/ddm_membership/FnsoJ/h/Lesson_12_Nostalgic.htm

In our current **DDM 545**, we ran into two really interesting things:

When I was a kid, those two things were ubiquitous containers for knickknacks—little things that we didn’t want to throw away! They were EVERYWHERE! And people used them to store EVERYTHING! Everything small!

In nearly every garage you could find coffee cans full of nails and nuts and bolts, they’d be full of change, and they made great containers for pens and pencils.

Cigar boxes—they were PERFECT for my baseball and football card collections! And my stamp collection. And for marbles and crayons and anything else that wasn’t too heavy! And they looked cool on a bookshelf plus you could stack them. I loved them!

But nowadays…coffee comes in resealable bags. Or plastic containers.

**And with the knowledge of the bad effects of smoking**, fewer and fewer people are buying boxes of cigars. I don’t think I’ve seen a box of cigars in a store in decades! I guess that’s a good thing…

**But the nostalgia—the sweet memories that I have about those things!** By just seeing those containers, I can smell my dad’s coffee, I can smell my grandpa’s cigar! I can visualize my coins~ I can visualize my baseball cards~

Good memories~

What about you? Did you ever use containers like those? **What sort of knickknacks did you store** in them? Do you still have them? What other things did we use as containers?

LME 13 http://archive.aweber.com/ddm_membership/5xaNJ/h/Lesson_13_Should_you_read.htm Should you read English OUT LOUD?

When reading in English, is it a good idea to read out loud? NO! Unless you have very good pronunciation, read to yourself!

 Yes, the opposite of “read out loud” is “read to yourself”!

Why? What happens when you read out loud?

If a student's pronunciation is “bad”, he will make his “bad” pronunciation stronger! Your eyes and mind are filled with English, but let your mouth and ears relax.
Reading SPEED will slow down a LOT! Reading to yourself is MUCH faster than reading aloud.
Your coworkers, classmates, friends and family will be ANNOYED!! It’s true!

Additionally, SPOKEN language is different from WRITTEN language.  We use many more “big words” when writing to be more precise. When we speak, however, we use easier words to be more efficient.

 One of America’s most influential writers was William Faulkner. Here’s an **excerpt** from one of his most famous novels called A Fable. Try reading it out loud

- excerpt: a passage (as from a book or musical composition) selected, performed, or copied : EXTRACT

Oh my god!! Did you give up? I stopped in the middle!! Books use more $10-words (big words) than we use when speaking. By trying to say them out loud, you will CUT YOUR FLOW—you will lose your rhythm and your speed will slow!

When I mispronounced a word, some people would smile and imitate the word just like I said. It embarrassed me and made me SO mad!! Again, it happens in every language, in every country.

If a person has bad pronunciation in a professional situation, it makes them sound “less intelligent”.  People might not want to listen to the speaker... Worse...the native speaker might focus more on your ACCENT than on what you are saying~~

After three days, you will stink

- stink: to be extremely bad or unpleasant eg<eg. the performance stank> that news really stinks>

Pittock Mansion

Built in 1914, Pittock Mansion is full of rich history of one of Portland's first families, the Pittocks. It is the perfect place to discover how Portland became what it is today.

Henry Pittock and future wife Georgiana Burton both crossed the ORGEGON Trail, separately, in the 1850s. Henry built his fortune as the publisher of The Oregonian newspaper, while Georgiana raised a family and funds for local charities. Together, the Pittocks helped transform Portland from small "stumptown" to bustling modern city. 

Goeorgiana and Henry lived in Pittock Mansion until their deaths in 1918 and 1919. In 1958, the last family members moved out and then mansion suffered damage in the 1962 Columbus Day Storm. Portlanders launched a fundraising campaign to save it, and in 1965 a restored Pittock Mansion opened to the public



http://pittockmansion.org/our-story/history/

BUILDING A LIFE, BUILDING PORTLAND

Henry Pittock (c.1834-1919) was born in London, England but grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1853, when Henry was 19, he headed west on the Oregon Trail **to seek his fortune**. A year later, his future wife Georgiana Burton (c.1845-1918) left Missouri with her family and headed west as well. When Henry and Georgiana arrived in the area, Portland was a frontier “stumptown” competing with Oregon City to become the major trade and industrial center for the region.

- stump: A stump is a small part of something that remains when the rest of it has been removed or broken off. 
  If you have a tree stump, check it for fungus



Henry found work as a typesetter at [*The Oregonian*](http://www.oregonlive.com/) at a time when the newspaper industry was **financially risky and fiercely competitive.** More than 30 newspapers **were launched in** Portland during this period. On June 20, 1860, Henry and Georgiana married and five months later, he was given ownership of the paper **in exchange for back wages**. Henry went on to transform *The Oregonian* into a successful daily newspaper that is still printed today.

- back wages:  is the difference between what an employee was paid and the amount the person should have been paid. ... For example, if an employer unlawfully fires an employee, the employee might be due back wages for the time he or she was not allowed to work.

AN ADVENTUROUS LIFE

While best known for being a successful newspaper publisher, Henry Pittock also built a financial empire by investing in real estate, banking, railroads, steamboats, **sheep ranching**, silver mining, and the paper industry. He was **an avid outdoorsman**, bicycle enthusiast, and was among the first group to climb Mount Hood. Georgiana Pittock became a founder and fundraiser for many charities and cultural organizations, such as the Ladies Relief Society, Women’s Union, and the Martha Washington Home, a residence for single, **self-supporting** women.

BUILDING A GRACIOUS HOME

It wasn’t until the early 1900s that Henry Pittock started planning his “mansion on the hill” **on property that had panoramic views of Portland, the Willamette River, and the distant Cascade Mountains**. Construction began in 1912 and Henry and Georgiana moved into the home in 1914 with eight other members of the family. The couple only lived in the Mansion for roughly four years before they died. Family continued to live in the home into the 1950s. The last residents, grandson Peter Gantenbein and his father, Edward, moved out in 1958 and **put the Mansion up for sale**.

- a panoramic view of ... If you have a panoramic view, you can see a long way over a wide area. 
- put ... up for sale

The Mansion sat empty for four years and was hit by the Columbus Day Storm on October 12, 1962. **Hurricane-force winds** damaged roof tiles and window panes which then allowed water to infiltrate the Mansion. By 1964, the Mansion was in poor condition and developers expressed interest in **tearing it down** and turning the estate into a subdivision. **Dedicated citizens of Portland rallied and assisted the City in raising the funds to purchase the property for $225,000, which included $67,500 raised by citizens**.

- pane: A pane of glass is a flat sheet of glass in a window or door
- infiltrate
- turn into subdivision
- Dedicated: devoted to a cause, ideal, or purpose : adj.  ZEALOUS <a dedicated scholar> 
- rally: unite to support 

SAVING PITTOCK MANSION

The work needed to restore the Mansion and transform it from a private residence to a public space took 15 months. In 1965, Pittock Mansion opened to the public as a historic house museum.

In 1968, the nonprofit Pittock Mansion Society was formed to **take on the responsibility of** furnishing the Mansion, taking care of the collection, and providing educational activities.

PITTOCK MANSION TODAY

In 2007, the Society took over the day-to-day museum operations from [Portland Parks & Recreation](https://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/) and has been operating the historic house museum ever since.

The Pittock Mansion Society is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization whose mission is to **inspire understanding and stewardship of Portland history through Pittock Mansion**. The Society also works with Portland Parks & Recreation to maintain and preserve the historic buildings. All admissions, memberships, donations, grants, and museum store purchases go to **support Pittock Mansion and its mission.**

LME 15 <http://archive.aweber.com/ddm_membership/NV1oJ/h/Lesson_15_Americans_using.htm>

In our last DDM assignment we were studying part of a TED Talk.

TED Talks are really popular because of their GREAT subjects and their GREAT speakers. And our assignment was great. BUT…we ran into a phrase that caused a lot of students a problem.

more so

“more so” is MOST COMMONLY used as an adverbial. It’s equivalent to “even more” and typically includes the word “than”.

**Check these sentences out** **(all written by my students)****:**

- **Women** create stable societies more so than **men**.

- If you cover your **eyes**, your **hearing** ability is enhanced more so than ever.

- This band is popular **now** and is likely to become even more so in the **future**.

*We could easily replace* **MORE** *with \**LESS** or **EQUALLY**, which is why English dictionaries prefer to write it as TWO WORDS and not one word.*

 In those examples, we are using “more so” to **CONTRAST** A and B. It shows a difference between A and B. That is the CORRECT usage of “more so”!

**But…damn daily English!**

In the TED Talk we studied, “more so” was used to **ADD** to A and **NOT** to **CONTRAST**. In this situation, however, “**MOREOVER**” would be a better word to use, but Americans sometimes don’t care about the rules!!

 In this usage, “more so” is similar to:

Not only A, but also B 

In addition to A, there is also B

There is A, not to mention B

And an example with *moreover*:

Cooking my own food is cheap, moreover it’s healthier.

 **Check these out** **(one sentence from my student, one from TED and two from me!)****:**

- I realized that I wanted everyone to like me. More so I am a hypocrite.

  Hypocrite:  
  If you accuse someone of being a hypocrite, you mean that they pretend to have qualities, beliefs, or feelings that they do not really have. 
  The magazine wrongly suggested he was a liar and a hypocrite. 
  N-COUNT disapproval 

- She became a bassist, more so a musician.

  bassist: A bassist is someone who plays the bass guitar or the double bass. 

- I coach, more so I inspire.

- Cooking my own food is cheap, **moreso** it’s healthier.

*It is more acceptable (recently) to write “more so” as one word.*

*Still, most dictionaries will NOT acknowledge “moreso” as one word!*

Chances are, the American will understand you. **Especially if you add, “You know what I mean?” at the end of your sentence!!**

LME  <http://archive.aweber.com/ddm_membership/AFbx3/h/Buck_up_But_not_always_.htm>

Tough and resilient.

That's my neighbor. When I took that picture, it was 26 below 0 Celsius! No problem for that guy. He's a male deer--we call them bucks. 

We have an expression: **Buck up**!

It means, "be tough" or "be strong".

"Don't be weak". Be like a buck!

Our buck comes by every evening for some snacks. My wife gives them some feed--she likes having the deer around.

We don't usually see the bucks, though. The does (females) and yearlings (deer that are almost one year old) are the most common visitors.

So why has he been visiting? 

Because of the BRUTAL cold. While the deer can survive in the super cold weather, they don't want to waste much energy running around. 

SO...our FREE food is a great deal! He can come, eat and then go back to rest!

 **Even the toughest sometimes need help**.

The same goes with everything. You might think you don't need help. You might think getting help is weak.

You might think that it's better to do it yourself than to get help.

But that's not always true.

You might just be wasting your time. And other people's time, too.

Don't be too proud to NOT take help. At the same time, be happy when YOU can offer help, too!



When I was a kid, we had those containers, too. I kept cigar boxes to store "Bons Points" that my teacher gave me when I was either a good girl or if a had done a good job. After earning 10 bons points, we could exchange them for an image of animals or whatever. We still have coffee cans in France, especially for instant coffee. Yes, good memories of my childhood.



THIS is what I love about teaching English through DDM. How else could we come up with the subject of old coffee cans and cigar boxes? And how nice it is to know that as a child, just like me, we kept some treasure in these containers!! Thank you for sharing, Chantal!

 Hi Daisy! Oh...they all look SO delicious! You know, when I visited China (Hong Kong), I never saw anything like these dishes. And when I ate at nice Chinese restaurants in Korea, I never saw ANY of these dishes! If I go to China, you'll have to tell me exactly where to go. Food will be my top priority!!



 Hi, there!  I'm giving answers to the questions you asked me in the last newsletter. And I'm also attaching some additional pics... So here is my route! A short description...I took the train from Strel'na (my neighborhood) to a station called "Platform 68km." I was on the train with my MTB. The body of water is called "The Gulf of Finland." 2nd (pic). The weapons are from WWII 1941-1945 battles. 

 As to the lighthouse, it's a landmark but still active, you can see a light signal on top of it. And next to it is a modern ships' traffic control station. It was getting rather late so I decided skip food in order to catch train. All in all, it was a spontaneous adventure. I didn't plan it... The places were new for me, but I  really enjoyed visiting them! 

- spontaneous:  happening or arising without apparent external cause

Yes, like you, I have a desire to go on little adventures! I have a t-shirt that my wife bought me which says, **"Not all those who wander are lost"!** It's a quote from Tolkien! And it describes me. And I think it describes you, too!

I’m making drawings!!! The book’s coming along great. T**he freedom that will allow me to make any of my ideas a reality is within sight.** More updates soon^_^



Hmm!! I like me some STEAK!! **Did you cook it rare, medium or well-done?** This IS a test... 

15 minutes to change a flat? Wow! That's very quick! The last time I changed a flat...30 years ago!! And right now, with all the snow, I hope I don't have that problem!

 And your book is getting closer and closer to being finished! I, and I think all of the LME family...WE are really looking forward to it! And finally Luka! Luka has a LOT of fans, Matt. We get mail specifically directed towards Luka. Perhaps we should hire him to do some coaching!!

- Red moon...shaky Coach Shane!

Mikey was in his crib when all of the sudden deer started showing up in our backyard.

- crib: baby bed with high sides made of slats

He started screaming and hollering!

- holler: If you holler, you shout loudly. (mainly AM, INFORMAL) 
  The audience whooped and hollered. 

I think he got scared because the buck was chasing all the other deer away!!

He was probably angry at the buck!

That's it from me! I hope you guys have a super week. I'll be back in your INBOX tomorrow with another English lesson!

LME 17 http://archive.aweber.com/ddm_membership/E0Xu3/h/Lesson_17_Phrasal_Verb.htm

If you want to speak good “daily English”, there are FOUR things you must master.

Pronunciation & Phrasal verbs & Get/got usage & Pronouns 

 I talk about these four areas of daily English in my DDM classes all the time. They look easy—trust me, they’re NOT!!

Phrasal verbs are SIMPLY: an action verb + a preposition

Here are some examples…

- Shut up, shut down, shut off ,

- Go on, go through,  go by,

- Break out, break down, break up

Most of the time, the preposition (actually, it can function as a preposition OR an adverb—but that’s too much grammar!) gives extra information about the verb. And it’s usually easy to understand IN the context.

We have to know the context. We have to know the situation.

One phrasal verb can have SEVERAL possible meanings. An easy example would be GO DOWN:

- When the sun **goes down**, it’s much colder.   SINKS
- I told my wife I lost my job…that didn’t **go down** well. ACCEPTED *(received)*
- My weight has **gone down** since January first. DECREASED
- The game is **going down** at 7pm.  STARTING
- Your team is **going down**!  LOSING *(especially badly)*
- Let’s **go down** together. TRAVEL *(to the south, towards downtown, to a lower elevation)*
- My computer **went down** last night. BROKE *(stopped working)*
- Will Trump **go down** as a great president or a terrible president? BE REMEMBERED *(historically)*

That’s why I tell my students,

**Do NOT ignore phrasal verbs.**

But I also tell them,

**Do NOT memorize phrasal verbs.** 

What should you do?

**USE THEM!**

- Talk with Americans—catch the phrasal verbs.
- Listen to podcasts and radio shows in English—catch the phrasal verbs.
- Read articles and books—recognize the phrasal verbs.
- Watch TV shows and movies—catch the phrasal verbs.

Sound easy?

No, it’s not! And the really sad thing: if you don’t learn your phrasal verbs, you’ll continue to have a really hard time with daily English. The good news: Phrasal verbs are my specialty!

In EVERY DDM lesson we meet phrasal verbs. And we see them being used in a situation. The situation is easy after I explain it—and that makes the phrasal verb easy to understand.

And a few weeks later, we see the SAME phrasal verb again in a different situation. And my students recognize it and they can SEE that it is either the same or a bit different. And we talk about it.

Without a coach, without someone to ask, learning and mastering phrasal verbs is NOT easy!!

 Let me give you a QUIZ! In the following FOUR sentences, we can use the same phrasal verb (just change the tense). Can you figure out which is best? Don’t use a dictionary!! REAL LIFE, okay?

**Which of these phrasal verbs can go in ALL FOUR sentences below?**

**Go through**    **Bring up**    **Run down    Put off**

1. I                            a difficult time when my grandmother died.
2. Our proposal did not                      . But I promise that I’ll try again.
3. As a runner, I would                       3 or 4 pairs of running shoes every year.
4. I                            my resume and didn’t find any mistakes.

\1.    I **went through** a difficult time when my grandmother died. 

\2.    Our proposal did not **go through**. But I promise that I’ll try again.

\3.    As a runner, I would **go through** 3 or 4 pairs of running shoes every year.

\4.    I **went through** my resume and didn’t find any mistakes.

- caveat: A warning or caution: “A final caveat: Most experts feel that clients get unsatisfactory results when they don't specify clearly what they want” (Savvy). 
     b. A qualification or explanation.

e.g 2. Law. A formal notice filed by an interested party with a court or officer, requesting the postponement of a proceeding until the filer is heard.



When you speak English, we often have words that GO TOGETHER.

For example,

**Black and white**

I really like black and white photographs.

**Read and write**

In elementary school, they teach students to read and write.

**Suit and tie**

If a guy works for a bank, he should wear a suit and tie.

 

Now, what’s IMPORTANT with these pairs of words—you MUST say them in that order! If you say “a white and black photograph”, people will look at you STRANGE!

 Of course, it is possible to switch the order—there’s nothing wrong contextually—but native speakers commonly use THE SAME ORDER!!

So, here’s your quiz: Choose the correct order!

- For breakfast I love having  bacon and eggs. 

- For dinner, though, I’m a meat and potatoes  guy! 

- Do you have a  pen or pencil ?

- I need new  pots and pans  for my kitchen.

- Put on your shoes and socks                        .   

- I work outside rain or shine                        .   

- Life has its  ups and downs                    .

- After getting hit, his eye turned  black and blue                            .

- Do you want any salt and pepper on your eggs?

- Hotels are nice, but I prefer a quaint bed and breakfast  much more.
  - Something that is quaint is attractive because it is unusual and rather old-fashioned. 
    ...a small, quaint town with narrow streets and traditional half-timbered houses... 

The answers are [HERE](https://parmyproductionsllc.box.com/s/s5ckov9t3fpcpm8pw5imz53fieu5fxxh)!

**A quick recap:** **black and white****,** **read and write****,** **suit and tie****,** **+10 more pairs**

 I am in awe that you have so much grit to self-teach yourself UX design. 

It will be helpful if someone can show you the rope. No one person can answer all the questions. That’s why you need a board of mentors. I’ve learned so much from the people around me, my mentors, colleagues, friends and online.

Having a higher goal than just finding a job will help you sail through ups and downs.

**TO LEARN: stick with it, sticky fingers, stick in your mind** 

Hi , In DDM 547 my students ran into the word “stick” twice.“sticky-fingers George"

- We’re gonna stick with the calzones (*a type of food*).
- When I find something I like, I stick with it.

 Stick is one of those words that has DOZENS of definitions and is used MANY times each day. It’s a word that you NEED to master if you want to be good at daily English.Like I always say to students at the intermediate and advanced level: In order to improve your daily English—STOP memorizing and start using. “using” includes **listening** to English (podcasts, radio, music) and **watching** English (TV, movies, etc.)!

So, let’s go back to STICK.

I’m guessing that these two are easy for most of you:

- “We’re gonna stick with the calzones (*a type of food*).”
- “When I find something I like, I stick with it.”

They mean: you will NOT change.

- You will continue to eat calzones.
- Once you find something you like, you’ll continue to eat (*any verb*) it.

But what about the first one?

1. “sticky-fingers George”

That means that George likes to STEAL things! It’s an idiom and the image of it is funny! Imagine you have “honey” on your fingers…then whenever you touch something, it sticks (attaches/adheres) to your fingers! Do you know anyone with sticky fingers? My cat Minty has sticky fingers!! She loves to steal my pen caps~ But people with sticky fingers…they might be stealing your money!



After you learn new expressions like theseà

MAKE your own sentences!

LOOK for other examples online!

If you do that, those new expressions will STICK IN YOUR MIND!! You won’t forget them!

 

Perhaps you should inquire: 

pay attention to your vowel sound : e

succulent : Succulent food, especially meat or vegetables, is juicy and good to eat. 

supreme court :

abduct

communist

- zodiac: the “belt” of stars we see on the “ecliptic”. The ecliptic is path of the sun as the Earth orbits it. The belt is broken into 12 parts which each have a major constellation. Those constellations make up the zodiac.

- constellation: A constellation is a group of stars which form a pattern and have a name.

- Zinger: surprising or shocking news/information. When Shane said he was  married— that was a real zinger!

- Starstruck: to be in awe/shock/admiration of (usually) a celebrity! When you see a movie star and you are so surprised you can say anything

- what's the latest buzz? what's the latest news? 

- cosmos

- Zodiac signs:the 12 constellations that are seen along the ecliptic 

- To sort it all out: to clear

  up the confusion, to set us straight, to explain it to us

- A shakeup: a reorganization. Every time a new president begins work, there’s a shakeup in top management

- Buzzing about: talking about

- Planetarium: a room with a rounded ceiling on which projections of the solar system are displayed. It allows the study of the stars and planets as they move in unison.

- Astrologers: people who “predict the future” by considering your birthdate and time and comparing it with the alignment of the stars and planets

- Orbit: the curved path a planet takes as it goes aroundits sun...satellites and comets, too!

- comet: A comet is a bright object with a long tail that travels around the sun. 
  Halley's Comet is going to come back in 2061. 

- Aligned to the starts: lined up with the stars, in synch with the stars

- Babylonians: the people from the ancient civilization of Babylon

- A bit off: not quite accurate

- Word is...: some people are saying

- Constellations: permanent groups of stars that make up the zodiac

- Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn

before you start reading a new horoscope, word is there are actually two different zodiac calendars. Most Westerners follow the tropical zodiac based on seasons instead of constellations, and nothing has changed there.

- horoscope : a description of what is going to happen to sb in the future, based on the position of the stars and the planets when the person was born

LME 20 http://archive.aweber.com/ddm_membership/M2Qr3/h/Lesson_20_Know_the.htm

From about 7:30am until 8 or 9pm, you’ll find me at my desk. In front of two computers, four monitors, two cameras and microphones. My desk is where nearly ALL of my work gets done.

I’m sure you are the same. **Sitting at our desks is how most of us earn a living.** I don’t mind that…but I think my **butt** is getting bigger!!

Today I want to talk a little about “furniture”. Specifically, the difference between **desks** and **tables**.

My wife’s desk is *actually* a kitchen table. She uses that because she wants a huge area to work on. My desk is a regular **L-shaped desk**. My son has a desk, too…or is it a table?

What’s the general difference?

Desks are for WORKING and STUDYING! And they usually have a drawer, but not always.

Tables are for EATING or for MEETINGS with several people. Most of you have a table in your kitchen or dining room.

My desk has a drawer. It also has **two electricity outlets** (where you can plug in an electronic device) and it**’s cable-friendly** (there are holes in the frame and top of the desk to **run computer cables through**).

My wife’s desk has NO drawer. Like I told you, it was sold as a kitchen table. But she has a huge area to work on. I’m a bit jealous!

Mikey’s desk…I call it a desk because I’ll want him to eventually color and read and write there. But it has no drawer! But I won’t want him to eat there, so I’m not going to call it a table! It’s very sturdy…so I guess that one day it’ll become a ***footstool***!!

As you can see, **tables can be both**—a table or a desk. But **desks are only desks**!

These days, **standing desks** are very popular. What do you think? Would you like to have one? I think I would like one!!

And if you have a sofa in your living room, you might have a COFFEE TABLE! Those are perfect for coffee, magazines and remote controls.

So, what’s on your coffee table? Your desk? Your kitchen table? Send a picture, maybe we’ll include it in an **upcoming Tuesday’s English Magazine!**



Technology: Distracting, Disturbing, Deceiving, & Deluding Ourselves To Death

 https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-01-28/technology-distracting-disturbing-deceiving-deluding-ourselves-death?from=singlemessage&isappinstalled=0

- Delude: If you delude yourself, you let yourself believe that something is true, even though it is not true. 

[*Authored by Jim Quinn via The Burning Platform blog,*](https://www.theburningplatform.com/2019/01/27/technology-distracting-disturbing-deceiving-deluding-ourselves-to-death/)

> *“What Huxley teaches is that in the age of advanced technology, spiritual devastation is more likely to come from an enemy with a smiling face than from one whose countenance exudes suspicion and hate. In the Huxleyan prophecy, Big Brother does not watch us, by his choice. We watch him, by ours. There is no need for wardens or gates or Ministries of Truth.*
>
> *When a population becomes distracted by trivia, when cultural life is redefined as a perpetual round of entertainments, when serious public conversation becomes a form of baby-talk, when, in short, a people become an audience and their public business a vaudeville act, then a nation finds itself at risk; a culture-death is a clear possibility.”* ― **Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business**

- Vaudeville: vaudeville is a type of entertainment consisting of short acts such as comedy, singing, and dancing. Vaudeville was especially popular in the early part of the twentieth century. (mainly AM; in BRIT usually use music hall) 

**Something as mundane as using the restroom at work sometimes ends up triggering deeper thoughts about technology – its benefits, deficiencies and danger to our culture.** I’ve been using the same restroom at work for the last twelve years. They remodeled the restroom a few years ago with the latest technology – automatic flushers, automatic soap dispensers, automatic spigots, and automatic towel dispenser. This technology is supposed to make things better, but from my perspective the technology just added complexity, glitches and unnecessary complications.

- mundane : Something that is mundane is very ordinary and not at all interesting or unusual. 
  Be willing to do mundane tasks with good grace. 
  ...the mundane realities of life. 
  ADJ-GRADED 
  = boring 
- spigot: A spigot is a faucet or tap
- glitch: A glitch is a problem which stops something from working properly or being successful. (INFORMAL) 

First off, these technological “improvements” did not eliminate any humans from the equation. The housekeepers responsible for the restrooms continued to be employed. Prior to the remodel they would fill a metal bin with individual paper towels and fill the soap dispenser with liquid soap. Now they have to insert a roll of paper towels in the electronic dispenser and a cartridge of soap in the electronic soap dispenser.

- A cartridge is part of a machine or device that can be easily removed and replaced when it is worn out or empty. 
  Change the filter cartridge as often as instructed by the manufacture. 

Instead of doing this daily, they wait until they are empty before replacing the towels and soap. That means they run out during the day. It must be dozens off times when I’ve washed my hands and put my hands in front of the automatic towel machine and nothing comes out. Then your choice is going to a stall and using toilet paper or wiping your hands on your pants. When it’s not empty, **it jams 20% of the time.** The automatic faucets stay on too long or go off by themselves with no one near them.

The bottom line is this bathroom technology was costly, requires ongoing costs for battery replacement, did not eliminate any labor costs, malfunctions at a far greater rate than the previous manual devices, and provides less service and satisfaction than the non-technological methods.

This led me to ponder whether this microcosm of technological dysfunction and dissatisfaction applies to technology on a much larger scale, as technology has been sold to the masses as the solution to all of our ills and a sure sign we are progressing as a civilization and culture. Technological advances have given the masses the false impression their lives have gotten better, when in reality the technology has enslaved and controlled them while providing a never-ending distraction from reality, critical thinking and the truth.

> *“Americans no longer talk to each other, they entertain each other. They do not exchange ideas, they exchange images. They do not argue with propositions; they argue with good looks, celebrities and commercials.”* ― **Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business**

With virtually everyone in America having access to the internet, smart phones containing more computing power than NASA used to launch rocket ships into outer space, and the proliferation of computers even in the poorest school districts, the masses should be far more intelligent and informed than previous generations. But nothing could be further from the truth.

**Technology is wasted on people who haven’t been taught to think critically, have been indoctrinated by government run schools to be subservient cogs in the machine, and believe feelings and emotions are more important than knowledge and understanding.** The proliferation of social media (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram) has resulted in the dumbing down of human interactions and replacement of discussing issues with virtue signaling, selfies, faux manufactured outrage, and glorifying shallow celebrities. We’re addicted to technology.

**It is incomprehensible our society has embraced technology for amusement, trivialities, and superficial displays of diversion, rather than advancement of knowledge, proliferation of ideas, and cultural progress and enrichment.** The works of Aristotle, Socrates, Shakespeare, Dickens, Twain, Tolstoy, Steinbeck, Orwell and Huxley are available with one click of your iGadget, but instead the masses choose to play Angry Birds, Candy Crush, and Madden, while worshipping at the altar of Kardashian. So much knowledge and wisdom at your fingertips, guaranteed to make you smarter and 99.9% choose to amuse themselves into a stupor of ignorance.

Are we just a society of intellectual lightweights, driven by emotions and sensitivities? Or is this infinite infantilism designed and implemented by those controlling the culture through their ownership of all media platforms? It appears to be a purposeful deliberate strategy implemented by the ruling class to dumb down the masses through the public education (indoctrination) system, divert their attention and thoughts through modern day electronic bread and circuses, enslaving them in debt, and pillaging global wealth and power through control of the political, financial, and mass media structures. And now they utilize the technology to spy on you and make sure you are not contradicting the establishment narrative.

> *“Our politics, religion, news, athletics, education and commerce have been transformed into congenial adjuncts of show business, largely without protest or even much popular notice. The result is that we are a people on the verge of amusing ourselves to death.”* **― Neil Postman**

If the daily machinations, intrigues, schemes, and plot twists broadcast 24/7 seem like an orchestrated reality TV show, it’s because they are. It’s nothing more than an enhanced Truman Show where we are all Truman. The controllers produce the daily disinformation propaganda; superficial story-lines designed to play upon your emotions; plot twists designed to invoke hope, despair, anger, fear, and desire; and a ceaseless mantra that the government, mega-corporations, Wall Street bankers, and chosen “experts” know what is best for us.

**They don’t want a citizenry who understands what is going on, how to think critically and question the establishment, or live within their means. They want obedient consumers** who believe what they are told by “authorities” and are just smart enough to follow the rules laid down by their superiors. A nation built on illusions, delusions, disinformation and confusion.

> *“Television is altering the meaning of ‘being informed’ by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation. Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information – misplaced, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information – information that creates the illusion of knowing something, but which in fact leads one away from knowing.”* **― Neil Postman**

**Television has always been an effective tool in keeping the masses under control.** Talking media heads, sold to the public as highly intelligent and educated journalists, mouthed their lines, written by invisible men working on behalf of the wealthy ruling class, to sooth the savage beasts known as the masses. Control the message and you control society.

**With the advent of the internet, what should have been a vast awakening and enlightenment of the masses, has just been a degradation to the lowest common denominator.** Social media platforms have eliminated thought, conversation, seriousness, knowledge, intelligence, and clarity from the public square and replaced it with narcissism, vitriol, virtue signaling, triviality, attacking anyone with a different viewpoint, and self-promotion.

Now that the Silicon Valley social media behemoth corporations have hundreds of millions addicted to amusing themselves to death, they can decide what is acceptable speech and that which doesn’t conform to their left-wing views. Censorship, public shaming, manufactured outrage and destroying those with an alternative point of view is now in the control of a small cabal of extremely rich men.

They use contrived incidents like the Covington High School kids “threatening” a “noble” Vietnam Vet Native American in a blatant attempt to spin their web of deceit. **Their technological control over public discourse is a threat to our freedom of speech and to our society.** Anyone who thinks for themselves is in danger of becoming an outcast and/or cyber criminal in our new dystopian existence.

> *“For in the end, he was trying to tell us what afflicted the people in ‘Brave New World’ was not that they were laughing instead of thinking, but that they did not know what they were laughing about and why they had stopped thinking.”* **― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business**

Neil Postman published his book in 1985, one year after the title of Orwell’s chilling view of a dark and brutal dystopian future. Postman’s view at the time was Huxley’s Brave New World dystopia had proven to be the more accurate assessment of the future. And he was probably right thirty-four years ago. He accurately assessed how the masses had been trained like Pavlov’s dogs to follow their emotions rather than their intellects.

**The average person actually thinks they are informed, when they have been programmed by disinformation peddled by the corporate media at the behest of their oligarch masters. Ignorance is not strength. War is not peace. Freedom is not slavery.**

The misleading information – superficial, irrelevant, fake news – is designed to create the illusion of knowledge when, in reality, it leads you away from knowledge. Postman didn’t think the dumbing down of Americans was deliberate. He attributed it to TV entertaining rather than informing.

I believe those in control of the levers of society have made a calculated effort to convince the masses their willful ignorance is actually knowledge. The ignorant are much easier to manipulate and lead down any path necessary to benefit those in charge. Accumulating wealth and power is much easier when the masses can’t think, understand basic mathematical truths, or comprehend reality.

**Postman compared the two dystopian visions at the outset of his brilliant tome:**

> *“We were keeping our eye on 1984. When the year came and the prophecy didn’t, thoughtful Americans sang softly in praise of themselves. The roots of liberal democracy had held. Wherever else the terror had happened, we, at least, had not been visited by Orwellian nightmares.*
>
> *But we had forgotten that alongside Orwell’s dark vision, there was another – slightly older, slightly less well known, equally chilling: Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World. Contrary to common belief even among the educated, Huxley and Orwell did not prophesy the same thing. Orwell warns that we will be overcome by an externally imposed oppression. But in Huxley’s vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy, maturity and history. As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think.*
>
> *What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy.*
>
> *As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny “failed to take into account man’s almost infinite appetite for distractions.” In 1984, Orwell added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we fear will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we desire will ruin us.*
>
> *This book is about the possibility that Huxley, not Orwell, was right.”* **― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business**



**Postman was most certainly correct in his assessment of our society in 1985.** TV was still the overwhelming method of information and entertainment for the average person. People still had newspapers and magazines delivered to their homes. Cable news had just launched. The internet was not in widespread use. Home computers were in their infancy. Cell phones for every person was a distant dream.

**Orwell’s dark future had not materialized, YET. Huxley’s subtler dystopia required far fewer authoritarian measures.** The unseen psychological manipulation of the masses, as described and practiced by Edward Bernays and his sycophants, was far more effective in molding minds, designing the culture, and forming the ideas of the masses without them realizing they were nothing but lab rats in a grand experiment. Propaganda works.

**Since 1985 the technological control over the masses has deepened and overwhelmed any resistance to its creeping governance of our daily lives.** The proliferation of computers, 24-hour cable TV and “smart” phones for the masses has given the unseen manipulators of the public mind, known as the invisible government, the ultimate tools for engineering our minds and deciding what will be perceived as the central beliefs guiding our daily lives.

We have come to love our oppression and learned ignorance, adoring the very technologies enslaving us in trivialities, disinformation, shallow displays of virtue signaling, and eliminating our capacity to think. The masses have passively acquiesced to their oppressors by allowing technology to completely control their lives and form their opinions.

**The corporate mass media, through social media platforms, the internet, and TV overwhelm the masses with useless information designed to distract and divert our attention from the subversive actions of the wealthy oligarchs pulling the strings behind the technological curtain. The truth has been and continues to be hidden behind an avalanche of irrelevant minutiae and nonsense, spewing from our Screens.**

The purposeful purveyors of this garbage into the minds of the masses play to the lowest common denominator by producing disinformation designed to amuse, provoke fear, confuse, inflame desires, and kindle emotions. They most certainly don’t want citizens thinking critically, questioning the status quo, ignoring their dictates, discussing the real issues and problem confronting the country, or generating ideas which could undermine their control and potentially reduce their vast riches.

I think Portman was being somewhat naïve in thinking the dumbing down of society through technological means and government-controlled indoctrination public schools was an accident. As seen in both novels, the controllers knew exactly what they were doing and why they were doing it. The Brave New World method of control has worked for decades, but the propagation of websites appealing to critical thinkers and those questioning the approved narrative has endangered this command and control structure of the Deep State.

**That is why our society is now devolving towards Orwell’s vision of the future.** Battle lines began to be drawn when Snowden, Assange and other selfless patriots of freedom revealed the level of deception, disinformation, and criminality of the state and those supporting the state. Technology is now becoming the boot stomping on our faces forever.

**The tyranny being inflicted upon the masses by the likes of Google, Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, and other tech behemoths on behalf of their Deep State benefactors is chilling in its depth and depravity.** The oppression from the current day Big Brothers through censorship, banning of truth tellers, demonetization of those who don’t conform, and public shaming of dissenters has replaced the soft tyranny of mental manipulation.

The establishment now openly suppresses the truth through their control of all mainstream media channels and outlets. The alternate media is scorned and ridiculed as conspiracy theorists, nutjobs, and Russian collaborators. The level of fake news vomited by Deep State propagandists has reached a new level of hysteria. Dissenting viewpoints are crushed through economic penalties inflicted upon those who dare go against the approved doctrine of the state.

The use of technology to control the minds of the masses has produced unintended consequences which threatens the power of the Party. **A true Surveillance State, more comprehensive than Orwell ever conceived, is operating in full view.** Trying to lock down the internet has proven to be difficult for the ruling class as more and more critical thinking, pissed off citizens congregate on truth telling websites and stir discontent among the awakening masses.

The election of Trump seems to have been a lightning rod for the discontent to bubble to the surface. There is an all-out technological war being waged between the corporate oppressors and those they are trying to control. The current escalation will surely lead to all out violent war in the foreseeable future.

Huxley’s soft tyranny, where we have been conditioned to obey and never consider revolution, is being replaced by Orwell’s vicious tyranny where persecution, torture and power will be on full display as this revolution begins in earnest. Portman was just early in his conclusion. **Huxley and Orwell were both right. The Party doesn’t care about us. They just use us to attain their own felonious needs. We need to break free from the chains enslaving our minds and take back our country by force.** Time is growing short. Will we meekly accept the fate of Winston Smith and John the Savage inflicted by the State or will we rise up against the technological tyranny oppressing our freedoms and liberties? The answer will decide our fate.

> “Now I will tell you the answer to my question. It is this. The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power, pure power.
>
> We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power. Now you begin to understand me.” – **George Orwell, 1984**
>
> "One believes things because one has been conditioned to believe them. Most men and women will grow up to love their servitude and will never dream of revolution.” – **Aldous Huxley, Brave New World**

*The corrupt establishment will do anything to suppress sites like the Burning Platform from revealing the truth. The corporate media does this by demonetizing sites like mine by blackballing the site from advertising revenue. If you get value from this site, please keep it running with a donation.*

Time flies. It's the end of January!  IF you made "new year" plans BUT have not had a good start...

No problem! A new month is always a good time to start  AND 

The Lunar New Year (Chinese New Year) will start on February 5th--one week from today!!

 Remember, "later is better than never". 

 **Quit delaying** and just start that thing you were thinking of doing! 

Another thing people say, "if you want something to get finished, give it to a busy person". That means, "busy people get more things done."

So, if you think you're TOO BUSY to start or do something new...maybe it's actually the perfect time!

A rally in Berlin (no animal farms, no glyphosate, no GM-food, no big corporations owning land and so on..

- rally:  A gathering, especially one intended to inspire enthusiasm for a cause

- glyphosate /ɡlaɪˈfɑset/
- GM - genetically modified - food

We had an email exchange regarding some of these photos. I think it's important that we participate in events that will make our world a better place. 

And can you think of a better place than your PLATE? We have so many different things to eat, but too many people are choosing things that are EASY but not necessarily HEALTHY or CLEAN.

I'm not a fan of big government--but rallying people together to share ideas: that's always a good thing.

Hello, coach Shane!

I am Svetlana, from Russia. Thank you very much for your lessons. They are very useful. I love your lessons. 

 In the pictures, a cake that I made myself. But I'm still learning :) The second  photo shows Christmas treats. And the next photo below shows French macaroons. They're delicious! :)

I would say that you are **doing a great job learning how to** make and decorate these delicious treats! And this is a great way to "learn some" English, too!

 **Keep up the excellent work** and please continue to share more pictures of your baking achievements!!

Those are really well-kept antiques! You take many pictures of these old cinema gadgets. I'm wondering, do you ever purchase any? Are you planning a museum of your own? Do you know how to operate any of them? **Keep us informed, please!!** 

- antique: An antique (Latin:antiquus; "old", "ancient") is an old collectable item. It is collected or desirable because of its age, beauty, rarity, condition, utility, personal emotional connection, and/or other unique features. It is an object that represents a previous era or time period in human society.

A little update from me. Last Saturday, the Russian Orthodox Church celebrated Epiphany. So I took several pics at our local monastery. Many people took the plunge into an ice-hole as a part of the Epiphany celebration. 

- Epiphany: Epiphany is a Christian festival on the 6th of January which celebrates the arrival of the wise men who came to see Jesus Christ soon after he was born. 
- monastery: a house for persons under religious vows especially : an establishment for monks
- take the plunge : to do or undertake something decisively especially after a period of hesitation or uncertainty

UGH!! Polar bears!! How can they stand there so casually? I would love to do that in the winter IF the water were actually **a hot spring**!!

And it looks as though you did not participate in the plunge. Good. Stay healthy!

Is that **giraffe** made from snow???!!!

The monastery looks great in the snow! Really nice pictures. I'm sure you all had a wonderful celebration! Thanks as always, Andrey!

Hi, CS! How are you doing?

I'm sending you **shots of some of the New Year decorations** at my office and outside near my job. 

Hi Coach Shane,

**Just if you're curious:**

From the ugly chrysalis the butterfly called Papilio Rumanzovia came out. Kamila named her Ladybug. She lives 7-10 days. Now is her 7th day with us.

- A chrysalis is a butterfly or moth in the stage between being a larva and an adult. 

The small orange butterfly called Biblis, she lived with us 16 days, when normally they live only 14 days. She's a granny butterfly. We respect her with the whole family). 

BTW Morpho is still with us, and this is her 12th day. But they say they live 3-4 months, honestly I don't think that she'll live so long with us. But we'll see...

Kamila is doing an excellent job raising these butterflies!! It must be a very good experience for her. And...sorry...**it's actually a great way for a child to learn about LIFE and DEATH**.

Got snow... We **got hit with two pretty big snowfalls in just over a week**. LOTS of **shoveling and plowing**. I still have one deck to go. Anyone want to help? It's the deck on the side of the house where I have my barbecue grill. It is FULL of snow. I'll send a picture probably next week.

Ugh...very pretty but very heavy! 

Making my coffee. What sort of ingredients do you ADD to your coffee? Do you only drink it black? Let me know! If enough people share their secret coffee recipes, maybe I'll share mine!!

**Brrr. (That's what we write when we want to say IT IS COLD!!)** 

We feed the birds and deer. The deer get fed in the evening in those three big feed buckets. But in the afternoon, I add some sunflower seeds for the birds. The temperature was -35 at 2 in the afternoon.

Tomorrow will be just as cold!!! IT IS FREEZING OUTSIDE!! Perfect weather for staying INSIDE and reading, studying, watching a movie!!

- scheme: A scheme is someone's plan for achieving something. 
  ...a quick money-making scheme to get us through the summer... 
  They would first have to work out some scheme for getting the treasure out. 
- paradigm: A paradigm is a model for something which explains it or shows how it can be produced. (FORMAL)

LME 22 http://archive.aweber.com/ddm_membership/MfFh3/h/Lesson_22_How_MUCH_do_you.htm

Are you a movie buff or a movie lover or a cinephile?!

-   buff: You use buff to describe someone who knows a lot about a particular subject. For example, if you describe someone as a film buff, you mean that they know a lot about films. (INFORMAL) 
    Judge Lanier is a real film buff. 
    Any competent computer buff should be able to do it for you in a few minutes. 
    N-COUNT: supp N 
    = enthusiast
- cinephile: A film or movie enthusiast.

Well, they’re all BASICALLY the same. However…if you ask someone who calls themself a cinephile…they might tell you they’re different!

So, let’s TRY and see if we can differentiate the three!

Movie lovers: they LOVE movies! Usually popular, mainstream movies. They often go to the latest movies, watch movies on TV and buy DVDs or Bluerays. They can tell you WHO starred in WHAT! Movies are a **hobby**

Movie buffs: they are a bit more serious. They usually watch a wider range of movies…often they’ll watch ANYTHING. They like to really know who starred in what, who the director was, when it was made, etc. These guys, compared to normal people, can be…different! Movies are an obsession.

Cinephiles: these are the wine-drinkers of movie-watching! They are VERY proud of watching movies that no one else has ever heard of. They like artsy, low-budget, non-Hollywood films. These people are also different! Harmless, but intense! Movies are a **religion**!

- artsy: Someone who is arty seems very interested in drama, film, music, poetry, or painting. People often describe someone as arty when they want to suggest that the person is pretentious. (INFORMAL) 
  Didn't you find her a little bit too arty? 
  ...an arty French film. 
  ADJ-GRADED 
  = artsy

Well…those are MY definitions of each. And I’m sure many people would want to disagree with me. BUT, I’m also sure that most people would actually agree!

LME 23  <http://archive.aweber.com/ddm_membership/Lp8W3/h/Lesson_23_Let_s_DRINK_.htm>



We might look different, we might speak different languages, we might believe in different things…but we do have ONE thing in common. We ALL eat and drink!!

Today I’m going to introduce a few DRINKING verbs that you can use when you're drinking ANYTHING: tea, milk, water, beer, whiskey, etc!

Since I’m a beer lover, I’ll use beer in my examples, okay?!

**Nursing** a beer…

If you are nursing a beer, you’re drinking it very slowly! I do this a lot—one beer can take over an hour! Sometimes two!!

**Sipping** a beer . This is similar to nursing, but if someone SIPS something, it’s usually because:

It’s very hot; It’s too cold; It’s too strong; It’s too bitter; It tastes bad!; It tastes VERY good!

**Swigging a beer**, When you are hot and thirsty, swigging your drink is exactly what you want to do! You lift it up and take several gulps (swallows). You might even drink the whole thing. ONE POINT to remember; we tend to swig things that are in bottles or cans, not glasses or cups.

**Chugging a beer**

Perfect for drinking an entire glass of beer! Or water…or Gatorade…or whatever! Again, you can imagine the sound you make while drinking~ “Glug, glug, glug, glug~”

- chug:  a dull explosive sound made by or as if by a laboring engine

**Slamming a beer**

This is what we do when we want to celebrate AND drink hard! You can slam milk…but it’s much more common to slam a beer or a shot of whiskey! You pick up the drink FAST and drink HARD and SLAM the drink back down on the table or bar!

-  slam: If you slam something down, you put it there quickly and with great force. 
    She listened in a mixture of shock and anger before slamming the phone down.

There are MANY more verbs you can use when you are drinking—but I think those five are the most FUN and the most COMMON!

**A quick recap:**

Below, as you go to the right, your drinking motion gets faster/harder...

**nursing** **->** **sipping****->**  **swigging****->** **chugging****->** **slamming**

2014 is here! I wish you and your family the best! I hope that you have set goals and made plans for the New Year. I have. My first goal is to quit smoking, my second goal is to compete in **sprint-triathlons**, and my third goal is to create more videos and podcasts for you than I did in 2013. I am confident that I can achieve my goals.

If one of your goals is to study English, stay with me! I promise much more free content in 2014! If you are really serious about English, then I ABSOLUTELY recommend investing in yourself and taking DDM classes.

 What will you get?  You will start MASTERING American English pronunciation. You will ABSOLUTELY improve your listening skills. Your English listening comprehension will ABSOLUTELY improve.

- The Real Resistance: Washington State Sheriffs Refuse To Enforce Unconstitutional Gun Laws<https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-01-29/real-resistance-washington-state-sheriffs-refuse-enforce-unconstitutional-gun-laws?from=singlemessage&isappinstalled=0>

This article points out the power that armed Americans hold as a final check against tyrannical government.  I lived in Washington state for 21 years and watched as many attempts were made to limit gun rights, but failed.  Now the left has won power and they intend to remain in control and to disarm the people.  It will not work.

- tyrannical: If you describe a government or organization as tyrannical, you mean that it 
  acts without considering the wishes of its people and treats them cruelly or 
  unfairly. 
  ...one of the world's most oppressive and tyrannical regimes. 
  ADJ-GRADED 

Long thought to be the last line of defense between authoritarianism and freedom, sheriffs are in a unique position. As elected officials, basically nobody has authority over them – not the judges, not the Feds – no one except the people who may or may not choose to re-elect them.

- sheriffs: an important official of a shire or county charged primarily with judicial duties (as executing the processes and orders of courts and judges)

**What are those new gun laws in Washington?**

In November, Washington voters passed a **ballot** initiative, I-1639. To purchase a semi-automatic rifle, buyers must be over 21, **undergo an enhanced background check**, must have completed a safety course, and need to wait 9 days to **take possession of** their weapon. And that’s not all. A gun owner who doesn’t store his or her weapon “properly” can be prosecuted.

And that was just the beginning of the **unconstitutional** momentum.

> **Feeling the wind at their backs after the ballot, gun campaigners and liberal legislators have now gone even further in the new legislative session**. Bills introduced in the last week to Washington’s Democrat-dominated legislature look to further restrict firearms. Some laws would ban high capacity magazines and plastic guns made with 3D printers. Others would mandate training for concealed carry permits, and remove guns and ammo during and after domestic violence incidents.
>
> Washington’s attorney general, Bob Ferguson, who proposed several of the bills, said in an email: “Now is the time to act. **Washingtonians** have made it clear that they support common-sense gun safety reforms.” ([source](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/26/washington-state-gun-laws-law-enforcement-rural?fbclid=IwAR301Jmy_3eqz-KyGBIBjlYyuDU4ukVItcb2r4j6yT00nIBOVOh-xcrIQXM))

- momentum: If a process or movement gains momentum, it keeps developing or happening more quickly and keeps becoming less likely to stop. 
  This campaign is really gaining momentum. 
  They are each anxious to maintain the momentum of the search for a solution. 
- wind at (one's) back
  A favorable position that encourages forward momentum (as with a ship that has the wind at its back). e.g. She really struggled in her studies last year, but she's had the wind at her back ever since changing her major.
- mandate: When someone is mandated to carry out a particular policy or task, they are given the official authority to do it. (FORMAL) 
  He'd been mandated by the West African Economic Community to go in and to enforce a ceasefire. 
  The elections are mandated by a peace accord signed by the government last May. 
  VB: usu passive 

Things are getting more and more difficult for gun owners in a state that has two very different demographics.

Washington is a reflection of the rest of the US.

The state of Washington is similar to the United States in general. The vast majority of the population lives in a few large cities, distant from the rural and small-town folks in a lot more than just mileage. **The left-leaning cities are in direct opposition to the more right-leaning rural communities**, but the rural communities are **under the thumb** of the city voters due to numbers.

- under the thumb: being controlled by sb. A term usually used to describe a person who is subservient in a relationship. 
  -see also "under the cosh"

Back when they voted on I-1639, [27 of the 39 counties were against the measure](https://results.vote.wa.gov/results/20181106/State-Measures-Initiative-Measure-No-1639-Initiative-Measure-No-1639-concerns-firearms_ByCounty.html), but because the twelve counties that voted FOR it were more populous, the initiative passed.

Does this sound familiar? If it weren’t for the electoral college in national elections, we’d probably have Hillary Clinton as our president, and she’s **notoriously** anti-gun. The situation of gun owners would look very different right now if that had happened.

Now the state is divided because the counties that voted against the measure are **refusing to be governed by unconstitutional laws to which they objected in the first place**

And they’re supported by their sheriffs.

*Some Washington law enforcement officers are refusing to enforce these laws.*

Klickitat County Sheriff, Bob Songer, Republic police chief Loren Culp, and Ferry County Sheriff Ray Maycumber are among those who have publicly vowed **not to enforce the new unconstitutional gun laws**.



Matt Marshall, the leader of the Washington Three Percent, is hoping to persuade other Washington counties to adopt **local second amendment sanctuary ordinances.** Next week, he meets with people in Lewis and Pierce counties to urge them to  adopt resolutions not to enforce unconstitutional gun laws.

This isn’t the first time that sheriffs have stood up against unreasonable laws.

As elected officials, sheriffs **have an obligation to their constituents and to the Constitution of the United States of America.**

In 2013, El Dorado County Sheriff John D’Agostini kicked the US Forestry Service out of his county.



This kind of action is firmly supported by the [10th Amendment to the Constitution, which reads](https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/United_States_of_America_1992), “The powers not **delegated** to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”

*The power of county sheriffs was upheld in the Supreme Court.*

In 1994, Graham County Arizona Sheriff Richard Mack and Ravalli County Montana Sheriff Jay Printz successfully **sued** the Clinton Administration **over** the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act.

Justice Antonin Scalia, Chief Justice William Rehnquist, and Justices Sandra Day O’Connor, Anthony Kennedy, and Clarence Thomas found that the Brady Act’s attempted **commandeering of** the sheriffs to perform background checks violated the tenth amendment.

- commandeer: to take arbitrary or forcible possession of

> 

The decision upheld the power of county sheriffs.

- uphold: If you uphold something such as a law, a principle, or a decision, you support and maintain it. 

*County sheriffs are the last legal line of defense.*

Legally speaking, our county sheriffs are the last line of defense in the battle for gun rights.

> Federal agencies do not have state powers. **Due to the Constitution’s structure of dual sovereignty**, the feds have no authority to enforce state laws. Furthermore, states cannot be compelled to enforce federal laws. ([source](https://blog.tenthamendmentcenter.com/2013/07/sheriffs-to-the-feds-you-are-on-notice/))

The next option is widespread civil disobedience, which we saw recently in New Jersey.

Try as anti-gun legislators and activists might, there is a difficult battle ahead for anyone who tries to disarm the American people. Between Constitution-supporting elected officials and American civilians who will not comply, the *real* Resistance seems to be ready…and armed.

Hi

It's the LAST week of August...is that good or bad? I'm very happy! September is the beginning of so many things in the US--school starts, American football starts, and fall (autumn) starts! September is such a great month. It is also the birth month of someone very special to me^^

But, August is important...especially August 27th--that my mom's birthday! I love you, mom!! Happy birthday!!!

So, did you have a chance to listen to our Let's Master English podcast 41, yet? This week's fantastic newsletter that Parmy made is down below. Just click on the picture and you can download the PDF!

We talked about a LOT of stuff in this podcast...but I will give you all something special:

The title of the news story is "Pinot No More". Do you understand why? It's actually a joke--a pun. There is an expensive type of wine called "Pinot Noir". It's difficult to make, that's why it is expensive. The pronunciation in America is like "pee-no no-are". Well, many **barrels** and bottles of Pinot Noir were destroyed in the earthquake...so there is "no more Pinot Noir".  "noir" and "no more" sound similar so I made the title "Pinot No More"!!! I thought I was the only genius who could think of such a brilliant title...but I discovered that 8 years ago, there was a New York Times newspaper article with the exact same title...oh, well!!!

Enjoy the newsletter, enjoy the week!

Your English coach,

Shane

LME 25 <http://archive.aweber.com/ddm_membership/FZAMp/h/Lesson_25_Americana_Monday_.htm>

So last Friday we started "Phrasal Verb Friday". **Huge success!**Thank you for all the emails. What about Mondays... How about "Americana Monday". We'll learn about America (USA) and American culture and American history. Hmm...that MIGHT sound boring to some of you, but let's see if I can make it interesting.

**REMEMBER**: Learning a language is MORE than just grammar, vocabulary and pronunciation. It's deeper than that!! Let's try!

In our recent DDM assignment, we learned about the **tip jar**.

In the US, you’ll see these jars in all kinds of businesses…

Convenience stores…Coffee shops…Take-out restaurants…Bakeries

And the question is: WHY do we need to tip them?!

In the USA, there are a few times when you ABSOLUTELY should be tipping:

In the case of a waiter at a restaurant or a server at a bar, tipping IS considered “**common courtesy**”. It’s something we SHOULD do. And there’s a reason; *waiters and servers can legally be paid LESS than \**minimum wage***—a LOT less. Minimum wage is the LOWEST you can pay an employee—different states have different amounts. People take those VERY low paying jobs because of the tips.

- common courtesy:  Courtesy is politeness, respect, and consideration for others. (FORMAL) 
  ...a gentleman who behaves with the utmost courtesy towards ladies... 
  He did not even have the courtesy to reply to my fax. 

**Movers**. Those guys are working HARD! As long as they don’t break anything or lose anything, they should get a nice tip!

**Hairdressers**. Well, I go to a barber and I’ve never tipped. But my wife tells me that you MUST tip if you go to a hair salon~

**Room cleaning service at a hotel or motel**. A nice tip encourages them to keep those rooms clean. If you’re a messy person, give them a very nice tip!

**Food delivery guys**! They’re driving fast to deliver your food fresh! Many times at night and in bad weather. Tip them nicely!

There are MORE examples!!! But tip jars at other businesses?! Well, don’t get too worried. The typical tip would just be change. The coins you receive after paying.
Let’s say I bought something and the cost was $4.69. I give the guy 5 dollars. He gives me 31¢ in change. I think to myself: the cashier is polite, everyone at the store is always nice, the store is clean… 
Hey! Go ahead and keep the 31¢ in change!  

Boom, I put the change in the jar! Tip jars are usually SHARED among all the employees. The money might go for a party or for lunch~ Sometimes it goes to the **“Employee of the Week”** (the best worker of the week)! But if you REALLY don’t want to tip your **barista**…just use a credit card! 

- barista: Pretentious sounding word used by dejected art history and drama majors that describes their employment in order to make themselves feel better about serving coffee. <https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=barista>

A quick recap: tip jar, common courtesy, minimum wage, change, Employee of the Weekcommon courtesy:  Courtesy is politeness, respect, and consideration for others. (FORMAL) 
...a gentleman who behaves with the utmost courtesy towards ladies... 
He did not even have the courtesy to reply to my fax.
