<Another year gone….>[http://english-speak-english.com/another-year-gone/]

On this last day of the year it can be instructive to take stock of what’s happening around the world. While many of us may live in relative peace and comfort, there are many people who do not. Given the current state of global affairs, I expect 2019 to be a pretty wild ride. The following are presented in no particular order of importance.

- be instructive
- live in relative peace and comfort

- take stock of what's happening ... = examine, see, list

Here’s a link to take a reading of some important points in the socio-political landscape of America.

- here's a link to take a reading of some important points in ..

It’s bad enough the the United States has allowed upwards of 20 million illegal aliens into the country, but this link shares details from FBI statistics that indicate roughly 8 million of those here illegally attempted to buy guns…illegally! To those politicians who assert the answer is “we need better gun control laws”, I say fuck-off and die! We need effective enforcement of border security. Limiting the rights of law-abiding citizens will do nothing to make us safer. Neither will it limit criminals from accessing firearms.



- it's bad enough that the ....
- upwards of : more than : in excess of <they cost upwards of $25>
- indicate 
- roughly
- To those ... who assert the answer  is "...", I say ...
- effective enforcement of 
- Doing sth. will do nothing to ..... Neither will it  do sth...



Democrats in congress seem to be more interested in blaming Russia for anything that ails the U.S.A., than fixing the problems under their noses. Now that their party has taken a majority in the House of (non) Representatives, it seems Trump may have his hands tied in terms of getting any further policy changes passed. Additionally, tension between Russia and the U.S. over the events in Ukraine has a chance of kicking off a nasty conflict between these two old rivals…..With respect to American or, any Western European country, I have to ask, what strategic interest / value does Ukraine hold? The “Deep State” wants more war….for more peace, of course.

- ail: If something ails a group or area of activity, it is a problem or source of trouble for that group or for people involved in that activity. 

  Blaming Russia for anything that ails the U.S.A.

The rot in higher education continued in 2018. Here are the Top-10 Most Outrageous Stories for the year.

  *The country's leaders are unwilling to take unpopular measures to stop the rot.* 

- outrageous:  If you describe something as outrageous, you are emphasizing that it is unacceptable or very shocking.



This link gives a snapshot look at the financial markets for the final day of trading in 2018. After pulling back in the earlier part of the year, gold has regained some of it’s luster currently trading at $1,282.  Oddly, silver remains lagging at $15.46. Perhaps it’s a good time to buy a little silver, while the price is still relatively low.



- give a snapshot look at ... 

- pull back  : If someone pulls back from an action, they decide not to do it or continue with it, because it could have bad consequences. 

- luster:  a superficial attractiveness or appearance of excellence . Gold has regained some of it's luster currently trading at  $1,282.

All over South America there are troubles; Argentina is mired in corruption. Brazil endures post-election problems, Chile is among many nations that continue to grapple with the world-wide problem of pedophile priests. Columbia continues to address their violent crime problems. Peru’s President Moreno deals with problems his administration inherited. Venezuela is the latest shining example of the failures of Socialism.

The Euro-project seems in more peril than ever, as the ‘Yellow-vests”, or Gilets Juanes…..as they are called in France, not satisfied with Macron’s concessions, continue to riot. He is perceived by the populous as being an elitist / Globalist and out-of-touch with the people. These protests are not isolated to Paris. They are widespread across the nation of France and give no indication of abetting anytime soon. So pervasive are these protests that the French government has considered declaring a national emergency. And all across the Euro-zone the migration issues is causing big problems. I suspect that Europe passed the point of being able to peacefully recover her social, historical and religious identity. They let the barbarians inside the gate.

- peril: exposure to the risk of being injured, destroyed, or lost : DANGER .   e.g. fire put the city in peril> 

  Euro-project seems in more peril than ever.

- barbarians: In former times, barbarians were people from other countries who were thought to be uncivilized and violent. 
  The Roman Empire was overrun by Nordic barbarians

- let the barbarians inside the gate.



Also, on the other side of the pond, Brexit seems in peril. It appears that Italy is going through what Greece experienced not too long ago, with respect to the ongoing economic issues between their country and the European Central Committee. Many Germans have had enough of the Merkel regime, thus she has declined to seek reelection, but not before she declared that “nation-states should give up some of their sovereignty“. Here is a report that cites impending changes to the German economy. The Irish Times files this report on some more of the unsettling events of the past twelve months.

- sb is going though...., with respect to the ongoing ... issues....

- Many Germans have had enough of the Merkel regime, thus...

Meanwhile, President Trump addressed the United Nations and informed that “the U.S. rejects the ideology of Globalism“. He may need to inform the other half of the country who are apparently a-okay with the notion of world governance. As well, leaders of the Visegrad nations (Hungary, Czech Republic, Austria, Poland and Slovakia) have formally and firmly asserted their rejection of Communism and the Euro-Central Committee’s demands to import massive numbers of Mohammedans from Africa and elsewhere. I’m glad that some leaders on the international stage have not lost all ability to exercise reason and logic.

- address sb = give speech to sb

- reject the ideology of ..

- who *are apparently **a-okay with** the notion* of world governance.

Religious freedom suffers another setback in Turkey. How is Turkey an ally of Western governments? Another ally of the U.S. government and long time recipient of U.S. military hardware, Saudi Arabia, had beheaded a total of 48 people in the first four months of this year. It’s hard to keep up with death counts of these barbaric regimes, but when beheadings aren’t good enough, these savages have used crucifixion in a pinch. Most of these “criminals” were non-violent offenders. Why is the United States allied with such backward and brutal thugs? What is the difference between the Saudis and the Iranians?

- suffer another setback in sth. 
  A setback is an event that delays your progress or reverses some of the progress that you have made. 

- an ally of western government

- savages = barbarians
- crucifixion = extreme and painful punishment, affliction, or suffering

I’m not particularly enamored with author Andrew Sullivan, but I think he is right about the Neo-Conservative response to Trumps plan for getting U.S. troops out of Syria and Afghanistan. The Establishment Will Never Say No to a War. This link makes the argument that Syria Was Never a Just War. …..So why are we there?



- enamored with sb =   feel a strong or excessive interest or fascination 
- Establishment <in capitalized : a controlling group 
- the link makes the argument that ...



As of December 22, the most recent outbreak of the Ebola virus, in Democratic Republic of Congo has taken the lives of 692 (known) souls. Record keeping is not the best in that part of the world, so the numbers of possibly infected people is basically a guess….and it could be much, much higher. Don’t eat bush-meat and run the other way if you see an African with symptoms of hemorrhagic fever coming your way! The communists under Cyril Ramaphosa continue to steal land, foment injustice and murder white land-owners in South Africa….and not much word of it in the news.

- As of Dec.22, the most recent

- continue to hold the title of ...when it comes to sth...
- talks seem to have stalled.  stall: a ruse to deceive or delay



From Japan comes this headline that speaks volumes about the idiocy of their current crop of leaders; Japanese cybersecurity minister admits he has never used a computer! You simply can not make this stuff up! Let us also not forget about Fukushima. It’s been seven years since the nuclear disaster that occurred at that power plant and radioactive waste continues to pour into the Pacific Ocean.



- speak volumes about : to provide a lot of information about something 

- idiocy of : something notably stupid or foolish

-  cybersecurity

- You simply can not make this stuff up = you have to believe it is true.

   make something up. —. to say or write something that is not true: I made up an excuse because I didn't want to go. 

- Let us also not forget about Fukushima
- radioactive waste continues to pour into the Pacific Ocean.



Further south in the Pacific, Java, near the Krakatoa Volcano that erupted recently, has resulted in the deaths of more than 400 hundred with many more still unaccounted for. Living on an island gives one little choice of avoiding the effects of periodic seismic shifts, volcanoes and tsunamis.

- with many still unaccounted for. 
-  avoiding the effects of periodic seismic shifts, volcanoes and tsunamis.



All I can say is, pray for peace and for justice for the oppressed. Be thankful for all you have. Keep your friends and family close. Let them know you love them. Hope for the best in the coming year and buy more ammo.

- oppressed: people who re oppressed are treated cruelly or are prevented from having the same opportunities, freedom, and benefits as others. 
  Before they took power, they felt oppressed by the white English speakers who controlled things. 

- ammo: Ammo is ammunition for guns and other weapons. (INFORMAL)

- My hugs to your family

Yes--the real meaning of Christmas, is remembering those in need and doing something for them. Sending children cards and gifts is a really wonderful thing to do.

- pedestrian mall

Wow--in the US, Santa flies around in a sleigh.  I wish you and your wife a SUPER 2019 with great health and success!

- sparse : Something that is sparse is small in number or amount and spread out over an area.  / of few and scattered elements especially : not thickly grown or settled

  A cymbal is a flat circular brass object that is used as a musical instrument. You hit it with a stick or hit two cymbals together, making a loud noise. 

- Ladybugs  that move~
- A tin soldier that bangs on a drum!

And…all of those toys were **WIND-UP** toys! On the side or on the back of the toy, there was a handle or a little pin that you “wind” and then the toy will “play”!

With the new year, many people want to make a new plan. A fresh start. Why not? It’s a great time to do something new, right?! But instead of DOING something…what about FINDING something?

Below is a list of “things” that people spend YEARS looking for. Some people never find them. What about you? I still have a LOT of “things” to find, but I think I have found a few! You can see them in blue.

FIND YOUR...

- Have you found your bliss? Your happiness

- Find your calling—the job that feels natural to you

  -  YES! For me, teaching!

- Find your destiny—God’s purpose for you OR your life according to the stars (astrology)

- Find your edge—your advantage that other people don’t have

  - Yes! I think~ The ability to explain difficult things EASILY to people

- Find your fate—your destiny

- Find your grind—the work (job) that is best for you

  - Yes! Working for myself online at home!

  - grind : dreary, monotonous, or difficult labor, study, or routine b : one who works or studies excessively* 

- Find your groove—*the lifestyle that is perfect for you*. 
  - Yes! The country life—like a farmer with a computer!
  - groove: a fixed routine : RUT b : a situation suited to one's abilities or interests : NICHE 

​      

- Find your passion—something you LOVE doing

- Find your purpose—your reason for living
  - Yes, I think. To help people by making them smile~

- Find your spirit animal—the animal you resemble in your daily life

- Find your style—the “look” (appearance) that is best for you

- Find your talent—a skill that you’re naturally good at
- Find your voice—the ability to express your thoughts and feelings easily
- Find your way—the path towards a happy/successful life
- Find your Zen—an inner peace where you are able to block out the rest of the world!

That’s it for today…**a little philosophical!!**

LME Lesson 4 <http://archive.aweber.com/ddm_membership/HYHUZ/h/English_Lesson_4_Enjoy_it.htm>

**TO LEARN: reddit, lurk, nootropics, subreddit,  AMA**

I highly recommend you check out reddit FOR YOUR ENGLISH!

Reddit.com is the 16th most popular website in the WORLD! Reddit is a place where you can find every type of subject and talk about it with other people. **Or you can “lurk”. To lurk means to “just watch”!!**

I go to reddit to find out information about “nootropics”. Nootropics are vitamins and foods and herbs that I can eat which help my BRAIN function better! Another “subreddit’ (subject in reddit) that I like is ELI5.ELI5 is short for “ExplainLikeImFive” or “Explain (difficult subject) as though I’m a five-year-old child”!!

In the ELI5 subreddit, people ask questions about science (LOTS of science), politics, religion or ANY kind of silly question that we don’t understand the answer to.

 That brings me to AMA. AMAs started on reddit—AMA stands for “Ask Me Anything”! Experts and politicians and **celebrities use AMAs to help people, to get to know people, and to satisfy people’s curiosities!**

Nowadays you can find AMAs on Twitter, Facebook, Periscope…**pretty much everywhere on the internet**!

That’s it for today! **A quick recap**: reddit…lurk…nootropics…subreddit…AMA

- A quick recap: 

- Have a super weekend!


**Book review about  [The Minimalist Home: A Room-by-Room Guide to a Decluttered, Refocused Life]**

This is an excellent book--logical, sensible, and worth reading. The one thing missing is "how" to get rid of things. Certain items, like used clothing, are covered, but the problem comes with family heirlooms you no longer want (and no one else does, either) or things, like valuable silver, that you can't just put in the trash. I've tried auctioneers (they don't want to deal with these things any more than you do), consignment shops (they tell me to come and get them), and there they are again, back in my house. What we need next is a book that really focuses on places to send things, not necessarily for monetary gain, but to ensure they don't end up in a landfill. My late mother-in-law used to say that you spend the first half of your life acquiring things and the next half trying to get rid of them. She was right. You can't just toss a two-hundred year old fish slice. So where do you send it?

- family heirlooms 
  An heirloom is an ornament or other object that has  belonged to a family for a very long time and that has been handed down from one  generation to another.

- consignment  shops: a dealer who pays only for what is  sold and who may return what is unsold <goods shipped on consignment*>

- landfill: A landfill is a large deep hole in which very large amounts of rubbish are buried

- you spend the first half of your life acquiring things and the next half trying to get rid of them

- You can't just toss a two-hundred year old fish slice. 

- tackle my mental and physical materialistic issues: 

  If you tackle a difficult problem or task, you deal with it in a very determined or efficient way. 



First off let me say I love Joshua Becker...have been following him for years. I have his first book and thoroughly loved it so was looking forward to this new book. Boy I was disappointed. The book is described as “a room by room guide to a decluttered refocused life.” Nothing could be further from the truth...every chapter(room) said the same thing-get rid of what you don’t want, keep what you love. Not very inspiring! If you preordered the book and are on Joshua's email list, you also received some online materials(minimizing checklist and a step by step minimizing checklist) I found those to be way more helpful, informative, and inspiring than the book itself. In fact I printed them out and put them in protective sheets in a folder so I can refer to them over and over. In those checklists he lists actual ITEMS to declutter and is much more specific as to how to proceed with your decluttering. I still think Joshua’s methods of decluttering and simplifying are the best-this book just fell short.

- refer to them over and over
- how to proceed with your decluttering. 



Many thanks to NetGalley, Waterbrook and Multnomah, and Joshua Becker for an ARC in exchange for an honest review. My opinions are 100% my own and independent of receiving an advanced copy.

Joshua Becker has been in the “minimal” business for about 10 years. He has a website where you can get lots of tips and advice, including a newsletter sent to your inbox every so often. He has written other books but this one is sort of the culmination of his life’s work. He has been on TV, speaks all over and I have been following him for the past couple of years.

- every so often: once in a while; occasionally

- this one is sort of the culmination of his life’s work.


 In today’s **world of massive consumerism**, we can all use a dose of paring down and keeping things simple. We all have too much stuff. **We are promoted, advertised, propagandized into thinking that it’s all stuff we need, what we have isn’t the right stuff and that the more stuff we have the happier we will be.** This has been going on for years, I mean George Carlin had a bit about “Stuff” in the early 80’s. So I was excited to read what Becker had to say on what he promotes as a step by step, comprehensive room-by-room guide to decluttering your home and your life.



- massive consumerism
- pare down:   to trim off an outside, excess, or irregular part. Pare down expenses
- be promoted, advertised, propagandized into thinking that.... 

Ugh - what an awful read. First I felt like his tone was so condescending. I couldn’t take it. Obviously I have a lot of stuff - that’s why I’m reading this book. He would repeat himself, ad nauseam, throughout the whole book. 

- his tone was so condescending. I couldn't take it.

- ad nauseam:  to a sickening or excessive degree


There wasn’t any comprehensive guide - again, he would repeat the same thing over and over for each room, literally the same steps - for each room! Why bother going through each room, listing all of the possible things you might have accumulated, telling me “get rid of what you don’t use or don’t need”. Obviously I knew that much! I don’t need a book for that. I was hoping for some insight, maybe some ideas that I hadn’t thought of to help declutter, some instructions. There was no real guidance other than “don’t do it” for lasting change. 

- there was no sth. other than ...



Then, don’t tell me how my life is going to change, I will become richer, have a fabulous job, help the poor, have more time, blah blah blah, just because you told me to get rid of some stuff. I didn’t buy any of it. I have decluttered before and none of those things have happened to me. The “real life” examples were ridiculous, laughable. Look, I believe in keeping a home without a lot of junk. Nobody needs piles of clothes, lots of knick-knacks, and yes, you should keep those things that mean something to you. 

- I didn't buy any of it.

- knick-knacks:  small objects which people keep as ornaments or toys, rather than for a particular use. 
  e.g. Her flat is spilling over with knick-knacks. 

You shouldn’t get sucked into marketing ideas of having the latest, greatest and best thing out there, which will go out of date and then you need something new. I also happen to live with a (mild case) hoarder, who believes every rock, piece of junk, paper, etc. is extremely important and sentimental and will not throw out anything. 

- get sucked into marketing ideas of ...
- out there 
- (mild case) 
- hoarder: a person loving accumulating items. 
- Sentimental means relating to or involving feelings such as pity or love, especially for things in the past. 
  e.g. Our paintings and photographs are of sentimental value only. 
  e.g. Perhaps he has returned for sentimental reasons. 



So according to Becker, those are the things to keep. Not helpful. But without something new or real to add to the discussion, don’t fill up a book with one idea. My advice is don’t add one more book to your bookshelf with this one.

- fill up: make full

  If you fill up or fill yourself up with food, you eat so much that you do not feel hungry

Beginning this year (2019) I will try and post a monthly topic of “special difficulties” in the English language. Words and phrases that are often confused or misused will be the primary focus, **but there may be other pointers that come up too.**

These words and phrases are worth saving in your vocabulary notebook for future reference.

Words often confused or misused.

Lesson 1

A) Phrases with the word **way**.

**In the way:** Please move this chair. It’s in the way. Do your work in the way I have shown you.

**On the way**: I bought a magazine on the way to the station.

**In this way:** He saves old envelopes. In this way, he has collected a great many stamps.

**By the way**: By the way, have you seen Sally?

**In a way:** In a way, It is an important film.  (to some degree)

The delivery man knocked at my door and he rang the doorbell.
I **knocked the vase off the table** and broke it.
He always **knocks off** at six o’clock on Fridays. (He finishes his work.)
The shop manager **knocked 10% off** the bill. (Reduced the price by 10%.)
A car knocked the boy over.. (It hit him and made him fall.)
The older boxer **knocked out** the younger fighter in the first round. (Hit him so hard that he caused the fighter to lose consciousness.)

- vase:  A vase is a jar, usually made of glass or pottery, used for holding cut flowers or as an ornament.

- Get ready for some serious wet weather coming your way!

[Forget El Nino, StormFest Is about To Hit The West Coast] <https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-01-04/forget-el-nino-stormfest-about-hit-west-coast>

Via Cliff Mass Weather & Climate blog,

Things often calm down after January 1 during El Nino years... but not this year... with the U.S. West Coast from central California to Washington State about to be pummeled by a series of storms.   Rain, snow, wind?  Plenty for everyone.

-  pummeled

A view of the latest infrared satellite imagery shows an amazing line-up of one storm after another stretching way into the Pacific.  A traffic jam of storms.

- infrared infrared  
  Infrared radiation is similar to light but has a longer wavelength, so we cannot see it without special equipment

- line-up
- a traffic jam of storms

**Wind?**  You bet.  Each of these storms will bring strong, damaging winds to a favored area of the coastal zone and mountain peaks. 

There is a **silver lining** of all this action of course:  it will provide an immense amount of water to fill our reservoirs and enhance our snowpack, a **snowpack** that is now in pretty decent shape (see latest summary below).  Water resources should be fine next summer.

- Silver lining: If you talk about a silver lining, you are talking about something positive that comes out of a sad or unpleasant situation. 
  The fall in inflation is the silver lining of the prolonged recession. 
  N-SING
- in a decent shape

But all these facts on the ground and favorable forecasts don't stop some of Seattle's wacky local media from talking about drought for our region, with the Seattle Stranger being one of the worst (see below). 

- wacky:  absurdly or amusingly eccentric or irrational : CRAZY <e.g wacky ideas> <e.g. a wacky comedian> 

Facts should matter---apparently not at the Stranger.

- hedge : a calculatedly noncommittal or evasive statement

My BAD LUCK STREAK (long period of time of continuous bad luck) was caused by BAD DECISIONS that I made.

- streak:  An unbroken series, as of wins or losses

But my BAD LUCK STREAK started to end, also, because of GOOD DECISIONS that I made. 

LUCK in life, good and bad, doesn’t usually happen in one day—it builds. It builds more. And then explodes. And, for some of us, it lasts and grows for years and years.

- explode: increase rapidly and in an uncontrolled manner

- Tough luck is when something BAD happens.

Sometimes you created the bad luck~ but Sometimes it just happens~

Tough luck happens ALL THE TIME!! But don’t allow “tough luck” to ruin your day.
