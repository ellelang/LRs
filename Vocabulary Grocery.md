<Another year gone….>[http://english-speak-english.com/another-year-gone/]

On this last day of the year it can be instructive to take stock of what’s happening around the world. While many of us may live in relative peace and comfort, there are many people who do not. Given the current state of global affairs, I expect 2019 to be a pretty wild ride. The following are presented in no particular order of importance.

- be instructive
- live in relative peace and comfort

- take stock of what's happening ... = examine, see, list

Here’s a link to take a reading of some important points in the socio-political landscape of America.

It’s bad enough the the United States has allowed upwards of 20 million illegal aliens into the country, but this link shares details from FBI statistics that indicate roughly 8 million of those here illegally attempted to buy guns…illegally! To those politicians who assert the answer is “we need better gun control laws”, I say fuck-off and die! We need effective enforcement of border security. Limiting the rights of law-abiding citizens will do nothing to make us safer. Neither will it limit criminals from accessing firearms.



- it's bad enough that the ....
- upwards of : more than : in excess of <they cost upwards of $25>
- indicate

Democrats in congress seem to be more interested in blaming Russia for anything that ails the U.S.A., than fixing the problems under their noses. Now that their party has taken a majority in the House of (non) Representatives, it seems Trump may have his hands tied in terms of getting any further policy changes passed. Additionally, tension between Russia and the U.S. over the events in Ukraine has a chance of kicking off a nasty conflict between these two old rivals…..With respect to American or, any Western European country, I have to ask, what strategic interest / value does Ukraine hold? The “Deep State” wants more war….for more peace, of course.

- ail: If something ails a group or area of activity, it is a problem or source of trouble for that group or for people involved in that activity.

The rot in higher education continued in 2018. Here are the Top-10 Most Outrageous Stories for the year.

  *The country's leaders are unwilling to take unpopular measures to stop the rot.*

This link gives a snapshot look at the financial markets for the final day of trading in 2018. After pulling back in the earlier part of the year, gold has regained some of it’s luster currently trading at $1,282.  Oddly, silver remains lagging at $15.46. Perhaps it’s a good time to buy a little silver, while the price is still relatively low.

All over South America there are troubles; Argentina is mired in corruption. Brazil endures post-election problems, Chile is among many nations that continue to grapple with the world-wide problem of pedophile priests.

Venezuela is the latest shining example of the failures of Socialism.

The Euro-project seems in more peril than ever, as the ‘Yellow-vests”, or Gilets Juanes…..as they are called in France, not satisfied with Macron’s concessions, continue to riot. He is perceived by the populous as being an elitist / Globalist and out-of-touch with the people. These protests are not isolated to Paris. They are widespread across the nation of France and give no indication of abetting anytime soon. So pervasive are these protests that the French government has considered declaring a national emergency. And all across the Euro-zone the migration issues is causing big problems. I suspect that Europe passed the point of being able to peacefully recover her social, historical and religious identity. They let the barbarians inside the gate.

- peril: exposure to the risk of being injured, destroyed, or lost : DANGER .   e.g. fire put the city in peril> 

  Euro-project seems in more peril than ever.

Also, on the other side of the pond, Brexit seems in peril. It appears that Italy is going through what Greece experienced not too long ago, with respect to the ongoing economic issues between their country and the European Central Committee. Many Germans have had enough of the Merkel regime, thus she has declined to seek reelection, but not before she declared that “nation-states should give up some of their sovereignty“. Here is a report that cites impending changes to the German economy. The Irish Times files this report on some more of the unsettling events of the past twelve months.

Meanwhile, President Trump addressed the United Nations and informed that “the U.S. rejects the ideology of Globalism“. He may need to inform the other half of the country who are apparently a-okay with the notion of world governance. As well, leaders of the Visegrad nations (Hungary, Czech Republic, Austria, Poland and Slovakia) have formally and firmly asserted their rejection of Communism and the Euro-Central Committee’s demands to import massive numbers of Mohammedans from Africa and elsewhere. I’m glad that some leaders on the international stage have not lost all ability to exercise reason and logic.

Religious freedom suffers another setback in Turkey. How is Turkey an ally of Western governments? Another ally of the U.S. government and long time recipient of U.S. military hardware, Saudi Arabia, had beheaded a total of 48 people in the first four months of this year. It’s hard to keep up with death counts of these barbaric regimes, but when beheadings aren’t good enough, these savages have used crucifixion in a pinch. Most of these “criminals” were non-violent offenders. Why is the United States allied with such backward and brutal thugs? What is the difference between the Saudis and the Iranians?

I’m not particularly enamored with author Andrew Sullivan, but I think he is right about the Neo-Conservative response to Trumps plan for getting U.S. troops out of Syria and Afghanistan. The Establishment Will Never Say No to a War. This link makes the argument that Syria Was Never a Just War. …..So why are we there?

As of December 22, the most recent outbreak of the Ebola virus, in Democratic Republic of Congo has taken the lives of 692 (known) souls. Record keeping is not the best in that part of the world, so the numbers of possibly infected people is basically a guess….and it could be much, much higher. Don’t eat bush-meat and run the other way if you see an African with symptoms of hemorrhagic fever coming your way! The communists under Cyril Ramaphosa continue to steal land, foment injustice and murder white land-owners in South Africa….and not much word of it in the news.

From Japan comes this headline that speaks volumes about the idiocy of their current crop of leaders; Japanese cybersecurity minister admits he has never used a computer! You simply can not make this stuff up! Let us also not forget about Fukushima. It’s been seven years since the nuclear disaster that occurred at that power plant and radioactive waste continues to pour into the Pacific Ocean.

Further south in the Pacific, Java, near the Krakatoa Volcano that erupted recently, has resulted in the deaths of more than 400 hundred with many more still unaccounted for. Living on an island gives one little choice of avoiding the effects of periodic seismic shifts, volcanoes and tsunamis.

All I can say is, pray for peace and for justice for the oppressed. Be thankful for all you have. Keep your friends and family close. Let them know you love them. Hope for the best in the coming year and buy more ammo.
