Hi Ezrie,

First,  we need to interpret the question in a mathematic way. 

You can think of the "percentage error" in E as the "changing rate" of  E ( i.e. how will E change with v if there is a "error"  $\Delta h$ in v)
$$
\lim_{\Delta h \rightarrow 0}\frac{E(v+\Delta h) - E(v)}{(v + \Delta h) - v} = \lim_{\Delta h \rightarrow 0}\frac{E(v+\Delta h) - E(v)}{ \Delta h}
$$
As you can see, this is the formal formula of derivative.

So then, we can just do the derivative of E in terms of v.  If $E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$, then 
$$
\frac{dE}{dv} = mv
$$
Please let me know if there is any question. Thank you. 



Best,

Hi Erize,

For question 12 : $y = \arcsin \frac{x}{4}$

The first derivative is : 
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{4}\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (\frac{x}{4})^2}} = \frac{1}{4}\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{x^2}{16}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{16 - x^2}}
$$
The second derivative is to apply the chain rule. 
$$
\frac{-1}{2}\cdot(16-x^2)^{\frac{-3}{2}} \cdot -2x =  \frac{x}{(16-x^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}}
$$





For question 14, $y = \sin (\arcsin(x^2))$, which equals to $x^2$

(This is because the arcsin function is the inverse of the sine function)

So the first derivative is : 
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x
$$
And the second derivative is jus the constant 2. 

Please let me know if you have any question. 





Hi Jay, 



It seems there is a typo (miss a negative sign) in Question 5 , for $\frac{\partial z}{\partial y}$

Would it be
$$

$$
\frac{\partial z}{\partial y} = \frac{1}{\frac{x^2}{y}}\cdot x^2 \cdot (-1)\cdot y^{-2} = \frac{y}{x^2}\cdot x^2 \cdot (-1)\cdot \frac{1}{y^2} = \frac{-1}{y}



Please correct me if I am wrong.  Thank you!

Best,

Zhengxin

$$
1. \int x^{\frac{5}{2}}dx = \frac{2}{7}x^{\frac{7}{2}} + C\\

2. \int \frac{1}{x+t} dt = ln(x + t) + C\\

3. \int \frac{1}{3x +4} dx = \frac{1}{3}ln(3x + 4) + C \\
$$
