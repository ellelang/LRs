- 6:30 woke up

- 6:50 got up

- 7:10 breakfast 

- 7:10-8:00 waste time on social media⋯

  every night  I also waste time on YouTube. The time should have been used for DDM or PIRF. The time in the early morning should have been invested for workout if it’s hard to begin research early!

- 8:31 got on the bus 

  *read paper on the bus*

- 9:00 arrived at office

- 9:10 checked my email, and got stuck at the ad of books

- 9:40 start to work finally...

  *3 hours between getting up and starting to work......*

- 10:15 finished wrote up the daily plan and review

  *should have done this at the last day night* ::artificial_satellite:
