Which of these six NO-NOs are you guilty of ?
The six NO-NOs here didn’t include my after meal habit.  Usually when I finish my meal, I will go to wash dishes while watching some TV shows , Youtube Videos, or listen to podcast. I don’t know if this habit will put my body in a risk. However, according to the reasoning in this article,  I do think my habit is not good for digestion because it distributes the energy and blood flow required for digestion elsewhere.

- Be it:  Everyday, I have to do some workout,  be it a five minutes yoga or an hour indoor cycling.
