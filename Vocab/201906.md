Which of these six NO-NOs are you guilty of ?
The six NO-NOs here didn’t include my after meal habit.  Usually when I finish my meal, I will go to wash dishes while watching some TV shows , Youtube Videos, or listen to podcast. I don’t know if this habit will put my body in a risk. However, according to the reasoning in this article,  I do think my habit is not good for digestion because it distributes the energy and blood flow required for digestion elsewhere. 

#### EVC 

- Is bad enough: Getting cold is bad enough, but missing the flight to the conference, it drives her crazy.

- Due to: I don’t like the movie due to the poor performance of the actors.

- Nature: The war was caused by the autocratic nature of the empire.

- Deficiency: Water deficiency becomes a crisis to the city.

- Be it:  Everyday, I have to do some workout,  be it a five minutes yoga or an hour indoor cycling.  

  - <be it is like "whether it be", a kind of conditional> 

  

I can't say anything to their **veracity**, but I do know that for generations (probably centuries...probably since the beginning of beds and sweets) humans LOVE to take a nap after a big meal and moms tell their kids to eat the healthy stuff and save the sweet stuff for last! Regarding micronutrient deficiencies--I agree with that. Especially since many people rely on processed foods and restaurants for their nutrition. Companies do NOT have your health in mind, they have their **coffers** in mind. And unfortunately, nowadays, doctors are about as trustworthy as an "inexperienced housewife".

**Everything in moderation...**I think those words are the best! And they can be applied to almost everything! 

- Veracity: (formal) the quality of being true; the habit of telling the truth
  Synonym: TRUTHFULNESS

I've been encouraged by an old friend to **press on with** my writing and this is one of my first essays.....outside of the usual blog stuff.

http://english-speak-english.com/essay-109-little-boy-lost/

- press on with: continue moving forward

- riveting: If you describe something as riveting, you mean that it is extremely interesting and exciting, and that it holds your attention completely. 

> The little boy knew intuitively that things were not right in his home, but he just didn’t understand what had happened to make everyone so sad and so quiet. **It seemed** his mom sat around crying all day for the past week. His daddy **looked pale with dark bags under his eyes**. When the boy would ask, “Where is Tom-Tom?”, everyone became more sad and then, they would say, “Tommy has gone to heaven.” And all the little boy could think was, where is heaven? And when will he be back? On Saturday morning after breakfast, while his mother and dad were sitting quietly in their sadness, the doorbell rang. The little boy ran, as every child does, to see who was at the door. As his father opened the door, the child noticed it was Tommy’s friend, Jimmy.
>
> Jimmy said, “Good morning!  Can Tommy come out to play?”
>
> The little boy thought, “Maybe we will get a better answer than ‘gone to heaven’ now.”
>
> The boy’s father tried to respond to the question, but his words choked him. The tall and fit man now in his mid-thirties, a decorated combat veteran of WW2, fell to the floor sobbing. Both Jimmy and the little boy looked upon the elder with confusion. Then, Jimmy ran home crying.

- looked pale with dark bags under his eyes
- a decorated veteran of WW2

Much of what I have **discerned** about the events following the death of my older brother have been gathered in pieces, many of them learned only much later in life, from cousins and neighbors. The little boy in the story (me) had suppressed this memory until 58 years later when the event was recounted to him by Jimmy’s younger sister.  

- Discern:
- suppress:
- relay: the act of passing something along from one person or group to another

At the moment she shared that story, the images of that day came **flooding over** me. It was such a strange feeling, like a **slow-motion dream with flashes of vivid images.** I realized that the story she told me, as **relayed** by her brother, was an actual event in which I was present. But the memory of it had been stuffed down a hole.

When Michele (Jim’s sister) told me the story this past Christmas, I could imagine myself about three when it happened. The entire episode, I believe, impressed upon my psyche some sort of unreconcilable gloom and left me with a life of creeping depression always lurking around me, like a dark cloud overhead and a strange feeling of loneliness, like I always missed someone.   I could never really put my finger on what was **bugging** me. Until later in life, after speaking with cousins who were closer to Tommy’s age and remembered him.  

Tommy was the big brother who never came back to finish playing our game together.  He just left and, as I was told, “went to heaven”.  My parents never really talked about him.  My mom went into some deep depression and **fell into the bottle for a time**.  My father **dove into** his work and **withdrew from many things**.  

The cause of death was Spinal Meningitis….where it came from is anybody’s guess.  At the time they were fearful that I might have contracted the same thing. I was hospitalized for several days’ observation, which included multiple spinal taps.  My dad was in tears when he told me about this many years later. The health authorities came around and vaccinated anyone who had been in contact with young Tom.  **To add further hurt to the grieving mother,** they also required that all of the deceased child’s toys and bed clothes be burned to prevent any possibility of the spread of the virus.  

When my brother Tom died, my younger brother was a baby, under a year old. As a consequence of this tragedy, he was **overly-coddled** by my mother and I was simultaneously abandoned emotionally and **left to fend for myself.**  

- If you have to fend for yourself, you have to look after yourself without 
  relying on help from anyone else.

My Dad died at 85 in 2005.  In the months before he died, I was dealing with my own troubles, far away on the left coast and I **harbor a bit of guilt** for not being available to assist him.  Mom passed at 94 in 2018.  She **outlived** four siblings by more than 30 years.  She was an anomaly in her gene pool, no doubt! She was essentially a good person with a kind heart, but she was a NYC girl with a **tough outer-shell** and a stubbornness like you can’t believe. My guilt was washed away after dealing with my dear mom for her final 10 years on this planet. **It almost felt like a form of penance!**  

When I was younger, I **was resentful** in some ways, but later in life, I came to understand that was pretty selfish. Even though, I was emotionally abandoned at a very early age, I know that it was not my parents’ fault. **No one comes equipped with a trusty guidebook on how to deal with unexpected familial tragedy**. So, I think that trying to forgive is a worthwhile **endeavor**, even if you don’t particularly like the person.

While helping Mom during the time of Dad’s funeral, I came upon a video. Mom had paid someone to convert old family 8mm movie film that Dad used to shoot onto a video format. **There were a lot of old memories stirred by that video**. And there was some **footage** of the day Mom and I came home from Chilton Memorial Hospital after my birth. As I watched this old film roll on, I was **consumed by a sort of diaphanous vision**. What an amazing feeling of mysterious warmth I experienced seeing this footage for the first time so late in my life. It felt like a warm blanket covering me! **This was a different perspective (with my dad as the cameraman) than the view I had in real life at the time.** If you can believe it, I remembered my brother’s beautiful smile as he greeted me and welcomed me to our family’s home. The video was haunting — eerie, ethereal, a true sense of *Deja vu*. It’s quite amazing what the human mind can store, suppress, wash-out and then surprisingly and unexpectedly be **triggered to resurface,** allowing it to be seen from a different angle.

**
Dear readers, 
This year, I have begun to **dabble in** expanding and improving my writing through the use of essays, some fictional and others about real life experiences. It was after reconnecting with an old friend from high school and learning of her background as a writer and editor that I shared a couple of short essays to get some feedback from a professional. Her comments were very encouraging and she inspired me to continue writing and see where it may take me. One thing I have learned is that **I am not such a bad writer after all**. I am a terrible editor!
I shared this story with her and asked for feedback. 
Obviously the subject matter in this particular essay is profoundly sad on a very personal level for me. However, with the encouragement of my editor friend, I feel like some sort of emotional weight has been lifted in some way. Hard to explain. In any case, the final version is what “came back from the editor”. 
I can tell you that it was much, much better than my draft. It was better organized for the reader to understand clearly and concisely. **This final version also flows more easily and that is essential to the art of writing.** I am grateful for the help my friend has provided. The corrections were instructive and helpful for improving my writing and I think the final product is more **coherent.**
