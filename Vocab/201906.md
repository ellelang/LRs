Which of these six NO-NOs are you guilty of ?
The six NO-NOs here didn’t include my after meal habit.  Usually when I finish my meal, I will go to wash dishes while watching some TV shows , Youtube Videos, or listen to podcast. I don’t know if this habit will put my body in a risk. However, according to the reasoning in this article,  I do think my habit is not good for digestion because it distributes the energy and blood flow required for digestion elsewhere. 

#### EVC 

- Is bad enough: Getting cold is bad enough, but missing the flight to the conference, it drives her crazy.

- Due to: I don’t like the movie due to the poor performance of the actors.

- Deficiency: Water deficiency becomes a crisis to the city.

- Be it:  Everyday, I have to do some workout,  be it a five minutes yoga or an hour indoor cycling.

I can't say anything to their **veracity**, but I do know that for generations (probably centuries...probably since the beginning of beds and sweets) humans LOVE to take a nap after a big meal and moms tell their kids to eat the healthy stuff and save the sweet stuff for last! Regarding micronutrient deficiencies--I agree with that. Especially since many people rely on processed foods and restaurants for their nutrition. Companies do NOT have your health in mind, they have their **coffers** in mind. And unfortunately, nowadays, doctors are about as trustworthy as an "inexperienced housewife".

**Everything in moderation...**I think those words are the best! And they can be applied to almost everything!
