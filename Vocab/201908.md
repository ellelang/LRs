**TO LEARN: August in the USA**

August is a VERY important month in the USA—especially for people under the age of 23. August is the END of summer…and by the middle or end of August, it’s time to go BACK to school!

This time of year, especially in the north where I live, there are many festivals and carnivals. When I was a kid in Park Falls, Wisconsin, we enjoyed Flambeau-Rama!

It was our local carnival with many rides, **softball tournaments**, dancing and drinking. Of course, the drinking was only for the adults! And tractor pulls! Those were great!!


When I was a kid, I was a HUGE fan of the **tilt-a-whirl** amusement ride. But now—just thinking about it makes me sick!


The giant swing or the **Ferris wheel** are much more my style now. Maybe even a merry-go-round!


The Viking. Not a fan. Bumper cars. Huge fan. Dunk Tank. Huge fan!


Carnival games…love them but they TAKE ALL MY MONEY! Cotton candy. Give me more!


Ah…the smell of cotton candy, the sound of the carnival, the hot days but the quickly cooling nights~~ It’s still summer, but it’s almost over!

Next week, let’s talk about BACK TO SCHOOL!

Enjoy your August! Send some pictures of YOU and AUGUST!

**A quick recap: August in the USA**

### LME Tuesday Magazine



Summer is ALMOST over--so HAVE a SUPER time.

Whenever you have a break, enjoy the sun.

Whenever you get a chance, get outside.

Not only does the sun give your body Vitamin D (super necessary for your health) it also helps your mood.

The BLUES and GREENS of nature are very soothing on your mind. Much better than anything mankind can create.

Every season has its benefits, but this season is ALMOST over, so take advantage of it!

- Victoria

This Tuesday's magazine blew me away^^ WOW! I reckon, at the beginning of 2020, we will meet your new bundle of joy! Thanks for sharing your happiness with us!  

I wish all the best to you and your growing family. May this special time be filled with love and joy. Congratulations!
Thank you SO much! Yes, that's exactly right. Doctors tell us that Mikey will have a new baby brother BEFORE the new year!! We are so happy and hopeful! Not sure how Mikey feels~!! 

- Vivian

 Congratulations, Coach Shane!  According to the last picture of your newsletter, Mikey will have a younger sister or brother! Did I get it right?

I got your newsletter and you said July was tough on you. I want to say these months have been tough on me, too.

On May 18th, I lost the one who loved me the most in the world. My father passed away in the hospital. 
He lived to be 85. For me, it wasn’t long enough. 

Baba saw me when his bed was pushed out of the ICU room the day after his surgery. He looked good. I called him, “Baba.” He asked me, “Are you picking me up to take me out of the hospital?” I didn’t answer but asked, “Are you hungry?” 

“Yes.”  “What do you want to eat?”  “Wonton noodles.”  

I went downstairs to buy a bowl of noodles, a bowl of hot milk and an egg. I fed him. He had a very good appetite--better than ever. He ate everything except the egg.

I didn’t realize that he already knew where he was going. I told him I will bring dinner to him later that afternoon. No one knew that was the last farewell.  

In June, my son Jimmy lost his opportunity to go to high school this year. It’s hard to understand and believe it. His grades on the high school entrance exam were average. We made a mistake or I overestimated his scores. We don’t want him to go to a private school with high tuition or a school far away from home. He would have to go to school very early everyday or we have to rent a house near the school.

So, we made a decision to keep fighting one more year in order to go to a better high school so that he might have more confidence in “GAOKAO”( the university entrance exam ) in the future. 

In fact, he regretted that he didn’t do his best. He promised he would work much harder for next year. 

On the good side, we traveled to Northwest China in July. It was amazing!

That’s the Chinese ancient Silk Road.  I felt so proud of my country during the trip because of the territory, history, ancient arts and culture.  Below is the biggest lake in China, Qinghai Lake. It’s like an ocean, isn’t it?

This is another lake in Qinghai province. It’s a salt lake. Its name in English is Jadeite because its color is like jade. You can also see the snow mountains in distance. So wonderful!

Two Tibetans and an endless flower field. 

It’s summertime, but the weather was very cold in the high land, 3800 meters altitude.

I had to wear a down jacket. 

We saw double rainbows in the sky after a thunderstorm!

I met some **Lamas** who were discussing Buddhism in a temple.

The Great Wall, the desert and a sand mountain. The sands have five different colors.  

The most impressive thing I saw was **Mo Kao Grotto** at Dunhuang, **the largest site of Buddhist art in the world. There are almost one thousand caves. Numerous painters and Buddhists took a thousand years and four dynasties to build and paint them.** 

The last one is my son Jimmy. He’s very shy and doesn’t like to take pictures. 

I hope he will make great progress in the exam next year, not only his grades but also learning methods and self-confidence.  


Hi Vivian! 

 Oh...the story of your father **brought tears to my eyes.** As you may know, I lost my mother early this year. I wish I could have been there--I'm SO glad that you were there. **Those memories will be cherished**. And I hope your son was able to have a good relationship with him, too. After all, school is important, but family is MUCH more important.

Your pictures and travels are EXCELLENT. You have visited places that I would also LOVE to visit. Thank you for sharing your pictures and your life with us! Please update us with all the news!

Hi Shane Since I came back here to Paris, I have been very busy.

I finally found time today to tell you more about our trip to the United States of America. 

Monday morning, May 27th, it was raining. We left Cleveland, Ohio and headed west to Michigan. We stopped in Saugatuck on the shores of Lake Michigan.

The weather was bad and the chain ferry didn’t work.


The day after we headed north to Michigan’s Upper Peninsula.  Driving on the Mackinac Bridge was an amazing experience. The bridge is a very, very long **suspension bridge**: 4.995 mi; 8.038 km. Arghh, I didn’t take any pictures of the bridge.

Our first stop in UP was Sault Ste Marie lock and dam. Big ships were coming and going between Lake Huron and Lake Superior

We rested a few days in Watersmeet, Michigan. Waterfalls were everywhere here. They say **Michigan has more than 200 waterfalls.**

But our aim was Minnesota. So we settled down first in Two Harbors, about 30 miles north of Duluth.


And if you are in this area, you have to go to Betty’s Pie. They made **divine** pies. We bought a five layer chocolate pie. It was fantastic.

North Minnesota is a very beautiful country. Lake Superior offers breathtaking views.


But the neighboring Wisconsin also offers beauties like the Apostle Islands Lake Shore. We took a tour through the Apostle Islands, three hours to view islands, lighthouses, old fishing camps and the wonderful sea caves of Devil's Island.


On the back way to home, we stopped to grab something in a nice bar.


If you wish, next week I’ll show you what we saw and did in the Twin Cities and on the Mississippi River.

Have a good week. 

Hi Nour-Eddine, 

What a fantastic journey in areas I am **somewhat familiar with**. I know the names, but I have not been there. Actually, I was in Sault Ste Marie in June. It was part of my journey through Canada looking for a final destination for my family! BUT...your pictures and the memories you made are so much more fantastic! 

YES!!! Keep updating and sharing your journey with us. Even though you are back safe at home, I want to know MORE! More FOOD, more PLACES, more RAIN and more SUNSHINE!!

So far, it looks like you two were having a great time!

- Vasily

 Hi, Coach Shane! I am intrigued by your last picture! :)

This summer is quickly flying by. Here are some moments of it. And thank you for your great lessons and upgrades!

Have a nice week!

Hi Vasily, I'm very happy you like the lessons and upgrades! I'm doing my best!! Who are all these people? Your family? Where are you? Is the little one your son? Did you eat the mushroom? The pictures are REALLY nice!! Don't be afraid to describe them for us. FEAR NOT--I will fix any English problems!!!

See you this week in AMA, Vasily!

- Finally, from Coach Shane

TODAY (Tuesday, August 6, 2019) is National Rootbeer Float Day.  Rootbeer is NOT beer. It's a soda. And it's really good. But it's really gooder with ice cream!! (Yes, I know, "really gooder" is NOT good English. But I'm talking about ICE CREAM and ROOTBEER!)

Oh~~ The blending of the two ingredients is HEAVENLY. I'm using a small mason jar for my ROOTBEER FLOAT. The taste is out of this world. Rootbeer alone is nice, but mixed with the creaminess of French Vanilla ice cream...OOH LA LA!!!

My son is getting braver and braver! His virgin feet walking for the FIRST TIME on a sandy beach. Actually, the beach was not that "nice". There were lots of bits of shells... Can you imagine what it's like to touch something FOR THE FIRST TIME! 

Scary. Exciting. Strange. Too much! 

Living life again THROUGH my son is one of the most amazing gifts in the world. 

And being able to help YOU with your English...I'm so thankful and blessed.

You guys have a fantastic week. Send your pictures and my best to you and your families!

Everywhere, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.We have a war on virtually everything --race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars. Every war you can imagine; we have people at each other's throat. 

Where did that spirit come from in America? Wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong. And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.

The majority of people in America actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great. They've been beaten into submission. It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
