**TO LEARN: August in the USA**

August is a VERY important month in the USA—especially for people under the age of 23. August is the END of summer…and by the middle or end of August, it’s time to go BACK to school!

This time of year, especially in the north where I live, there are many festivals and carnivals. When I was a kid in Park Falls, Wisconsin, we enjoyed Flambeau-Rama!

It was our local carnival with many rides, **softball tournaments**, dancing and drinking. Of course, the drinking was only for the adults! And tractor pulls! Those were great!!


When I was a kid, I was a HUGE fan of the **tilt-a-whirl** amusement ride. But now—just thinking about it makes me sick!


The giant swing or the **Ferris wheel** are much more my style now. Maybe even a merry-go-round!


The Viking. Not a fan. Bumper cars. Huge fan. Dunk Tank. Huge fan!


Carnival games…love them but they TAKE ALL MY MONEY! Cotton candy. Give me more!


Ah…the smell of cotton candy, the sound of the carnival, the hot days but the quickly cooling nights~~ It’s still summer, but it’s almost over!

Next week, let’s talk about BACK TO SCHOOL!

Enjoy your August! Send some pictures of YOU and AUGUST!

**A quick recap: August in the USA**

Summer is ALMOST over--so HAVE a SUPER time.

Whenever you have a break, enjoy the sun.

Whenever you get a chance, get outside.

Not only does the sun give your body Vitamin D (super necessary for your health) it also helps your mood.

The BLUES and GREENS of nature are very soothing on your mind. Much better than anything mankind can create.

Every season has its benefits, but this season is ALMOST over, so take advantage of it!

- Victoria

This Tuesday's magazine blew me away^^ WOW! I reckon, at the beginning of 2020, we will meet your new bundle of joy! Thanks for sharing your happiness with us!  

I wish all the best to you and your growing family. May this special time be filled with love and joy. Congratulations!
Thank you SO much! Yes, that's exactly right. Doctors tell us that Mikey will have a new baby brother BEFORE the new year!! We are so happy and hopeful! Not sure how Mikey feels~!! 

- Vivian

 Congratulations, Coach Shane!  According to the last picture of your newsletter, Mikey will have a younger sister or brother! Did I get it right?

I got your newsletter and you said July was tough on you. I want to say these months have been tough on me, too.

On May 18th, I lost the one who loved me the most in the world. My father passed away in the hospital. 
He lived to be 85. For me, it wasn’t long enough. 

Baba saw me when his bed was pushed out of the ICU room the day after his surgery. He looked good. I called him, “Baba.” He asked me, “Are you picking me up to take me out of the hospital?” I didn’t answer but asked, “Are you hungry?” 

“Yes.”  “What do you want to eat?”  “Wonton noodles.”  

I went downstairs to buy a bowl of noodles, a bowl of hot milk and an egg. I fed him. He had a very good appetite--better than ever. He ate everything except the egg.

I didn’t realize that he already knew where he was going. I told him I will bring dinner to him later that afternoon. No one knew that was the last farewell.  

In June, my son Jimmy lost his opportunity to go to high school this year. It’s hard to understand and believe it. His grades on the high school entrance exam were average. We made a mistake or I overestimated his scores. We don’t want him to go to a private school with high tuition or a school far away from home. He would have to go to school very early everyday or we have to rent a house near the school.

So, we made a decision to keep fighting one more year in order to go to a better high school so that he might have more confidence in “GAOKAO”( the university entrance exam ) in the future. 

In fact, he regretted that he didn’t do his best. He promised he would work much harder for next year. 

On the good side, we traveled to Northwest China in July. It was amazing!

That’s the Chinese ancient Silk Road.  I felt so proud of my country during the trip because of the territory, history, ancient arts and culture.  Below is the biggest lake in China, Qinghai Lake. It’s like an ocean, isn’t it?

This is another lake in Qinghai province. It’s a salt lake. Its name in English is Jadeite because its color is like jade. You can also see the snow mountains in distance. So wonderful!

Two Tibetans and an endless flower field. 

It’s summertime, but the weather was very cold in the high land, 3800 meters altitude.

I had to wear a down jacket. 

We saw double rainbows in the sky after a thunderstorm!

I met some **Lamas** who were discussing Buddhism in a temple.

The Great Wall, the desert and a sand mountain. The sands have five different colors.  

The most impressive thing I saw was **Mo Kao Grotto** at Dunhuang, **the largest site of Buddhist art in the world. There are almost one thousand caves. Numerous painters and Buddhists took a thousand years and four dynasties to build and paint them.** 

The last one is my son Jimmy. He’s very shy and doesn’t like to take pictures. 

I hope he will make great progress in the exam next year, not only his grades but also learning methods and self-confidence.  


Hi Vivian! 

 Oh...the story of your father **brought tears to my eyes.** As you may know, I lost my mother early this year. I wish I could have been there--I'm SO glad that you were there. **Those memories will be cherished**. And I hope your son was able to have a good relationship with him, too. After all, school is important, but family is MUCH more important.

Your pictures and travels are EXCELLENT. You have visited places that I would also LOVE to visit. Thank you for sharing your pictures and your life with us! Please update us with all the news!

Hi Shane Since I came back here to Paris, I have been very busy.

I finally found time today to tell you more about our trip to the United States of America. 

Monday morning, May 27th, it was raining. We left Cleveland, Ohio and headed west to Michigan. We stopped in Saugatuck on the shores of Lake Michigan.

The weather was bad and the chain ferry didn’t work.


The day after we headed north to Michigan’s Upper Peninsula.  Driving on the Mackinac Bridge was an amazing experience. The bridge is a very, very long **suspension bridge**: 4.995 mi; 8.038 km. Arghh, I didn’t take any pictures of the bridge.

Our first stop in UP was Sault Ste Marie lock and dam. Big ships were coming and going between Lake Huron and Lake Superior

We rested a few days in Watersmeet, Michigan. Waterfalls were everywhere here. They say **Michigan has more than 200 waterfalls.**

But our aim was Minnesota. So we settled down first in Two Harbors, about 30 miles north of Duluth.


And if you are in this area, you have to go to Betty’s Pie. They made **divine** pies. We bought a five layer chocolate pie. It was fantastic.

North Minnesota is a very beautiful country. Lake Superior offers breathtaking views.


But the neighboring Wisconsin also offers beauties like the Apostle Islands Lake Shore. We took a tour through the Apostle Islands, three hours to view islands, lighthouses, old fishing camps and the wonderful sea caves of Devil's Island.


On the back way to home, we stopped to grab something in a nice bar.


If you wish, next week I’ll show you what we saw and did in the Twin Cities and on the Mississippi River.

Have a good week. 

Hi Nour-Eddine, 

What a fantastic journey in areas I am **somewhat familiar with**. I know the names, but I have not been there. Actually, I was in Sault Ste Marie in June. It was part of my journey through Canada looking for a final destination for my family! BUT...your pictures and the memories you made are so much more fantastic! 

YES!!! Keep updating and sharing your journey with us. Even though you are back safe at home, I want to know MORE! More FOOD, more PLACES, more RAIN and more SUNSHINE!!

So far, it looks like you two were having a great time!

- Vasily

 Hi, Coach Shane! I am intrigued by your last picture! :)

This summer is quickly flying by. Here are some moments of it. And thank you for your great lessons and upgrades!

Have a nice week!

Hi Vasily, I'm very happy you like the lessons and upgrades! I'm doing my best!! Who are all these people? Your family? Where are you? Is the little one your son? Did you eat the mushroom? The pictures are REALLY nice!! Don't be afraid to describe them for us. FEAR NOT--I will fix any English problems!!!

See you this week in AMA, Vasily!

- Finally, from Coach Shane

TODAY (Tuesday, August 6, 2019) is National Rootbeer Float Day.  Rootbeer is NOT beer. It's a soda. And it's really good. But it's really gooder with ice cream!! (Yes, I know, "really gooder" is NOT good English. But I'm talking about ICE CREAM and ROOTBEER!)

Oh~~ The blending of the two ingredients is HEAVENLY. I'm using a small mason jar for my ROOTBEER FLOAT. The taste is out of this world. Rootbeer alone is nice, but mixed with the creaminess of French Vanilla ice cream...OOH LA LA!!!

My son is getting braver and braver! His virgin feet walking for the FIRST TIME on a sandy beach. Actually, the beach was not that "nice". There were lots of bits of shells... Can you imagine what it's like to touch something FOR THE FIRST TIME! 

Scary. Exciting. Strange. Too much! 

Living life again THROUGH my son is one of the most amazing gifts in the world. 

And being able to help YOU with your English...I'm so thankful and blessed.

You guys have a fantastic week. Send your pictures and my best to you and your families!

Everywhere, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.We have a war on virtually everything --race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars. Every war you can imagine; we have people at each other's throat. 

Where did that spirit come from in America? Wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong. And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.

The majority of people in America actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great. They've been beaten into submission. It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.

**TO LEARN: Back to School!**

When I was a kid, I LOVED going back to school. And August is when the new school year starts in the USA. My school always started on the second-to-last Monday in August. So, for this year, that would be August 19th—one week from today! There were four main reasons why I loved going back to school:

- I got to be with all of my friends again.
- Sports! All the school sports teams started and the games were great.
- NEW school supplies and school clothes.
- I did enjoy SOME of my classes!

I lived in a small town and a LOT of the kids lived here-and-there in a huge area—way out in the country. I had friends like Bob and Joe who lived very far away and during summer vacation it was almost impossible to meet them. So school was great!

In the fall, football (not soccer!) and cross country were my favorite sports. I was a little too skinny to play football, but I loved going to the games every Friday night. I was perfect, however, for cross country! And I loved not only the racing, but the training, too. The distance we ran was 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) and I had a spectacular experience! My best time was 15:45.

Regarding the classes that I liked—it wasn’t really the subject, it was the teacher. Mrs. Bogdonovich, Mr. Swenson and Mr. Delwiche were my absolute favorite teachers. Mrs. Bogdonovich was my 2nd grade elementary school teacher. She allowed me to study as fast as I wanted, and by the end of my 2nd grade year, I had finished all the reading and math books for not only 2nd grade, but 3rd and 4th grade, too! Mr. Swenson was one of my math teachers. He was SUPER boring, but I really liked his style of showing us example after example after example—he was my favorite math teacher! And Mr. Delwiche taught history. He LOVED to talk about controversial things and really challenged us to question everything. Including the news! And that was back in the '80s! Now most people in the USA question the news!

Finally—every year to start the new school year, all the students had new clothes and new school supplies! Notebooks, folders, pencils, erasers, highlighters, colored pens… Even now when I see the back-to-school sales at the stores, I kind of wish I had to buy some stuff! Fortunately, in a few years, I’ll have to take Mikey to buy stuff! It’s going to be great 😊

 

A quick recap: **Back to School!**

Have a great week! Next week, let’s talk about LUNCH BOXES! 😊

Read a good book.

Are you reading something right now? What is it? Please send a picture of you and the book you're reading. And give us a brief description, too.

Me? NOTHING!

Actually, I have SEVERAL books on my nightstand. But they're not getting read. I need to read them!

But **I'm in a rut.** A few years ago I was reading at least one book a week. But not now... In fact, I'll be lucky to finish five books this year.

BUT I know that this is a temporary problem. I'll be back into books soon.

And it's important. Especially reading non-fiction books. Do you know why?

Books actually make YOU a more interesting person. **Books are VERY effective at teaching us how to think differently. And they add so much color to our minds**. Of course, the wider variety of books you read, the more colorful your mind becomes. And the more colorful your mind, the more interesting you become. Ugh...I need some color! But first, let's enjoy this newsletter!

- Luciano. Hi Coach Share! I'm going to complain about the weather…

 

I really wish to have real winters in São Paulo (Brazil). We are on a plateau around 600 to 800 meters above sea level, so our weather isn't as tropical and warm as it could be, but it is still not cold enough in the winter as I wish.

Despite that, I love to have Chimarrão in the winter. It's a hot drink made of Mate herb, it's my caffeine fix and a substitution to coffee. Chimarrão is one of the names we have for drinks made of Mate herb, there’re others.  

This is an ancient herb that was consumed by **indigenous people** thousands of years ago in southern South America (**yeah, not the whole of South America**). Among others, the notorious Indigenous people known were the so called Charrua, they lived in a region that is now split between the countries of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. The European colonizers **assimilated some of their cultures,** like the consumption of Mate herb and the culture of barbecue made on bonfires - *"Churrasco" in Portuguese (Brazil) or "Asado" in Spanish (Argentina and Uruguay).*

Dear Coach Shane, I wish to know if you have already considered using your voice and pronunciation skills in audiobooks. I'd love to listen to audiobooks narrated by you.

Hi Luciano!  Wow. The pictures are PERFECT and the story you gave us is really excellent. YOU are a great storyteller! And I'm very happy that my voice is NOT annoying!! It's funny you ask about audiobooks...I really do want to do one. BUT...for children! Maybe one day. And I'll for sure let you have it for free, Luciano!

- Graziella

I spent my vacation in Russia this year. It was really something. My husband and I visited Moscow and Saint Petersburg.  These cities are totally different, beautiful and fascinating at the same time. 
The only way to communicate with  Russian people was with the English language and thanks to you I was able to speak with them. American English works everywhere.

Saint Basil's Cathedral is a church in *Red Square in Moscow, Russia* and is one of the most recognizable symbols of the country. The Moscow subway. Famous for its elegant and ample stations, the Moscow subway is among the cleanest and most efficient in the world. **Opened in 1935, the system has 13 underground lines and 206 stations that crisscross the city,** many of them decorated with **frescoes, marble columns and ornate chandeliers**.

**Matryoshka dolls** also known as Babushka Dolls. 

The Neva is a river in  Saint Petersburg. The city's traditional nicknames among Russians are the *Window to the West* and the *Window to Europe*.

Tsarskoye Selo is a town which has a former Russian residence of the imperial family and visiting nobility, located 24 kilometers (15 mi) south from the center of Saint Petersburg.  

Hi Graziella! What a FANTASTIC holiday. Again, the pictures are SUPER. You visited places I would also LOVE to see. What about food? Did you guys take any tours? Were the tours in English? I'm super proud of you! Oh, whose English is better--you or your hubby's?!! See you in class, Graziella^^

- Husan. Hi Coach Shane!

Below you'll see the theater where I used to work here in Valencia. Besides the many operas and concerts, we have a special program too, where we - literally - bring the music to small towns around the Valencian Community.

Literally, because the stage of the opera is built on a truck. It drives from town to town, and we perform a comedy-opera on the back of the truck. 

 The opera is "Bastian und Bastienne", the first opera **composed** by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart when he was only 12 years old. It is sung and spoken in the Valencian language, which is the same as Catalan. 

On the stage I say some words in Valencian and in German. My role is an orchestra on the keyboard with a bad character who yells at everybody, but then I fall in love with the dwarf. 

The "young artists" are young singers who have been selected from 300 people from all over the world. 

Every town we've played, there has been always a big success.  I usually play serious classical music, but sometimes I get the chance to play and act on a stage, like in the pictures...

Palau de les Arts, Opera theater of Valencia.

Truck Opera and the Audience, Open Air.

Mozart rocks! Meanwhile, make up on the bus. Behind the curtain, ready to begin the show...The Orchestra (me) and Bastian (tenor). Bowing. The crew after the performance.

Hi Husan, ENCORE!!! Bravo!!

Those are words that I know are appropriate after enjoying a **magnificent performance!!** The theater is magnificent, but the truck "theater" is outstanding, too! And your role is SO funny!!!

The touring must be exhausting... And the hours cannot be easy, too. I'm guessing your work often ends late at night. After work, does everyone go home or do they go to dinner? When does your day start?

The pictures are so **enticing**...but I know that not only I, but everyone else wants to HEAR THE MUSIC! Does this performance team have a YouTube channel? If so, you must tell us!!

Thank you, Husan! See you in class!!

- Mila

Hi Coach Shane,
First of all, I would like to express my great respect for the important job you and your team do. I adore English, my dream is to speak English fluently. I do my best to improve my skills every day by listening to podcasts. I did try some DDM and PIRF classes last year and they are so helpful. My main struggle is to apply the language, to express myself in a conversation fluently and discuss different things. So, I really need more speaking practice and I would like to try Action English class. Can I join the class? Is it available to join?

It's been a long time. I didn't send any news, but I'm still **keen on** the newsletters from you and the other ESL enthusiasts from nearly **all over the world.** It's been a very busy time of my life. I completed my dissertation. I was exhausted but totally **thrilled with** the results. I earned my science degree. In Russia it's called Candidate of Sciences degree, that requires at least three years of study beyond graduation from a university level higher education institution and the award of the Magistr diploma. I'm not sure, but I heard that it's similar to PhD in US. So, anyway I'm happy! Pictures below are my **magic potion** that always brings me extra power. 

 The formula is 100% deep dark coffee + 97,7% of dark chocolate = 197,7% of magic enlightenment

And then on top of it, a gorgeous and yummy fresh cherry and **apricots.** 

 

Hi Mila, Congratulations on your academic success!! What is next? Will you find a job? Will you teach? What are your plans?  YES! You can email Coach Clive directly and ask him if he has a time slot available for Action English--if you don't know his email address, email us again!

And your Magic Potion looks VERY magical!! Actually, my wife said that she wants to try that combination! But I have a question, do you put the chocolate INTO the coffee? Or eat it separately?

Regardless, the combination of the coffee, fruit and chocolate--truly an **excellent formula for brain AND body health!!** 

 

- **Finally, from Coach Shane...**

**Summer's last hurrah**~ Summer's almost over where I live and we are having our last HOT weather. It's **the last FIGHT of summer**! GOOD!

I was able to have Mikey enjoy the lake A LITTLE. He still hates walking on the sand, though!!!

Next year, I'm sure he'll LOVE the water. I hope~!!

LOL! Mikey is trying to get my Gorilla Mind brain power supplements!!! **Sneaky little devil!** This must be HOW he's becoming a genius at such a young age~!!!

My wife made me homemade LEMONADE! WOW~~~~~~~ So delicious! Thank you, honey! Yes, sure, I'd love another glass. But maybe...tomorrow! Yes, in the country where I live, we drink out of mason jars. We don't need regular glasses!!!

Awww~~~ I know, baby pictures can be REALLY boring. Too bad! I like them!!!

**TO LEARN: IPA (pronunciation) symbols will KILL you!** 

Hi ,

Wednesday’s Wisdom!

**DON’T USE IPA** symbols or **WRITTEN** spellings when you want to master pronunciation!

I’ve said this many times, and I’ll repeat it once again.

**DON’T USE IPA** symbols or **WRITTEN** spellings when you want to master pronunciation!

Why?

Because we have the internet. We have AUDIO files available to everyone! Just click on the SPEAKER icon or better yet, LISTEN and WATCH real English being spoken in real situations!!

If you are a beginner, you need to make an important decision. American English OR British English?

Of course, my recommendation is American English.

Once you decide, then start using American dictionar**IES**. Not just one, but use a few! Different dictionaries, believe it or not, will offer different pronunciations for the same word!

My recommendations are:

Merriam-Webster

Google.com (US version)

Dictionary.com

Check this out. I looked up the word TOWARD in all three of the dictionaries. I want you to look at the pronunciations highlighted in YELLOW. Crazy, right?!! They’re different!!! SO~~~

**DON’T USE IPA** symbols or **WRITTEN** spellings when you want to master pronunciation!

**USE the speaker icons**! Compare the three. Sometimes you’ll hear differences, sometimes you won’t. Then listen to your video or podcast and see how a “real” American pronounced the word.

AND, by the way, SOMETIMES we VARY our pronunciation!!!

For example, sometimes I say OFTEN with no T sound, but sometimes I say it WITH a T sound!!

Ugh~~

How can you learn HOW to really master pronunciation?

Easy—join our classes. Become a member. Join our LIVE classes, become a family member!

But remember ONE thing…

**DON’T USE IPA** symbols or **WRITTEN** spellings when you want to master pronunciation!

A quick recap: **IPA (pronunciation) symbols will KILL you!**

Have a great day! 😊
