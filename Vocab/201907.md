**TO LEARN: right around the corner, Little League, anniversary, a federal holiday, gets the day off, sparklers, bottle rockets, firecrackers, display**

Americana Monday!

Independence Day is **right around the corner** *(coming very soon)*—it’s this Thursday! Independence Day is considered the USA’s birthday! And this Thursday will be our 243rd birthday!

Wow…that suddenly makes me feel really old because I remember when it was America’s 200th birthday~ I was in **Little League***(baseball for very young boys)* and we played a special 4th of July tournament~!!

- tournament: a sporting competition in which contestants play a series of games to decide the winner

July 4th, 1776 is the **anniversary** *(birthday)* of our Declaration of Independence from England—when we told the King of England that we were INDEPENDENT! It’s **a federal holiday** *(a US government holiday)* and almost everyone **gets the day off** *(doesn’t have to work)*! This year, it’s on a Thursday so MILLIONS of people will take Thursday AND Friday AND the weekend off! That means MILLIONS of people will be traveling during the holiday to enjoy some summer weather!

Fireworks are a BIG thing during the 4th. Each state has different laws about fireworks. Things like **sparklers** *(first picture)* are legal in every state, but **bottle rockets** *(second picture)* and **firecrackers***(third picture)* are illegal in many states. I don’t buy any fireworks, but when Mikey is older I will!

Of course, public fireworks are the best. Most towns and cities have a large **display** *(showing)*. The best displays are over the water. If you have a boat, you are guaranteed a terrific view of the fireworks.

Camping, barbecues, parades, fireworks and swimming are MUST DOs during this summer holiday. And, personally, it’s also a really good time for Americans to think about “what it means to be an American”.

Does your country have an Independence Day? When is it AND send us pictures of how you celebrate it!

A quick recap: **right around the corner, Little League, anniversary, a federal holiday, gets the day off, sparklers, bottle rockets, firecrackers, display**

That’s it for today, have a SUPER 2nd half of 2019!

Sometimes strangers are kinder  than your own family and friends.

And sometimes we're kinder to strangers than we are to our own family and friends.


That's the way we are. Most of us. But I know we all agree: We should be nicest to our friends and family!

The reason is...comfort.

We feel comfortable around family and friends. Our minds relax. We are...natural. And that's a nice thing.

BUT...

Don't allow "natural" to become "complacent".

Complacency means that we have become comfortable--too comfortable--and we lose that desire to improve anything. Everything is "good" or at least "good enough".

Complacency is NOT a good thing.

Are you complacent anywhere in your life? Get out of that comfort zone and find a way to make yourself uncomfortable. That will force you to make improvement!

Start with your family and friends. Say something nice. Do something nice. Make sure they know that they really are your number one priority!

Let's check out OUR family's pictures...

Hi Shane 

Here are my answers!

I am having my dinner on my holiday and 

I didn't bring my laptop 

so I write the answers on napkin and then took a picture with my phone!! 

Have a good day.

 

I love it!! DDM on a napkin! On vacation! In such a beautiful place!! The dinner table looks fantastic with such a wonderful view!

What was for dinner? What did you do on vacation?

37°C/98°F in the sun is a very perfect time for selling lemonade!


In the picture: my daughter and her friend at their lemonade stand with one of their customers.

Your daughter is an entrepreneur! I wish I could run over there and buy a big glass of lemonade. BUT IT'S TOO HOT!! I heard, however, that this week in Europe it's much cooler. Is that true? 

 What will your daughter do with her riches? Save it? Spend it? Reinvest it? Tell me!!

Hi Shane. Monday, May 20th. 
Another week, another state. We leave Cape Cod, Massachusetts and head west towards Upstate New York. No more ocean nor beaches, but we are discovering beautiful, wooded areas.

Our first stop is Troy, NY. It’s a pretty little town near the state capital of New York which is Albany.  Cohoes Falls in Troy, NY. Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza, Albany NY.

 Second stop: Buffalo NY and Niagara Falls.

The weather was against us. We took two big showers: the water from the falls and the water from a heavy rain. This is the final result: soaked to the skin!

Let’s go to an area more welcoming and very peaceful: Ohio. We can see that America is a land of contrasts.


Below: the countryside in Ohi

We are ending our week in Cleveland. A very nice city.


I hope that you enjoy this travel report as much as we enjoyed our trip in the US.  Have a good day.  Nour-Eddine

Hi Nour-Eddine,

It looks like you and your wife are having more and more and more fun as the trip continues!! And your descriptions are so wonderful--I think by being in the USA that your English is improving!! 

I can't wait to talk to you in DDM VIP this week and ask you questions--Which state was your favorite? Did you find a food you especially liked? Did you have any problems? What did your wife like the most? Will you come back again?

Last Sunday we were in the Festival of Dances- Global Ballet Holidays.

My middle daughter is a fan of ballerinas,

so we couldn't miss it) Take care. Gulya

Hi Gulya, Such a classical little girl! Already a fan of ballet and ballerinas? I love it! If she wants to become a dancer, will you encourage her? What about your other kids? What dreams do they have?! How exciting. By having children, we can live life again!!

To the left, a hut.

 Some tomatoes, potatoes, strawberries, onions, dill, cucumbers, a gooseberry bush, Estragon weed...

 You can see the guard dog and trashburner. Also to the right is my shed and root cellar.

 The greenhouse belongs to a neighbor!

Below:

Homemade strawberry jam which is delicious! Tutsan and linden flowers for tea...acid-free tea which is really harmless after a meal!

Hi Alex, Oh my god... Your garden looks tremendous! The entire layout is so organized and lush!! What is the guard dog protecting the garden from? Rabbits? They can be pesky little creatures! SO MUCH JAM!! How long will that last? Do you share with your neighbors? Do you sell any at the market? Barter? And homemade tea... You are living the perfect life!!!

Beer! How embarrassing after looking at Alex's garden. I'm at a Walmart getting beer and oranges. And a shirt for Mikey~

Eating lots of fast food these days...hot dogs, McDonald's, Taco John's, Subway sandwiches, Chick-fil-A...you name it! This is JUST TERRIBLE.

 To be honest, though, I've been on the road SO much. I haven't been able to enjoy my wife's cooking. I went house-hunting out east. I went to a military base to get some of my OLD records. I went to a hospital for a special checkup. Over the last 10 days, I've only had 3 days at home.

So won't be too disappointed that I've been neglecting my diet!!!

Skunk brothers... and a deer. 

Those baby skunks CAN SPRAY, but so far they've been very nice. And actually they're really cute. I'm tempted to run out and hug one!! I won't~~

Then a bear! And I'll tell you why he likes our house...our chickens. It looks like he may have gotten one. That's not good. The last thing you want around your house is a bear!

Mosquitoes are no good, too! Mosquitoes are really bad where I live! If you don't protect yourself, they'll be on you in a second! You MUST NOT be complacent where I live. All be vigilant. Never be comfortable. Always be ready to move and conquer!!

 The same goes for your English, right?!

- vigilant:  carefully observant or attentive; on the lookout for possible danger

**TO LEARN: Which course should I take? Goals, Time, Money**



Which class should I take?

I get this question a LOT and I’ve answered it a few times. But let’s cover it again.

We have four different COURSES.

1. **DDM** (Daily Dictation Members) for improving your listening and comprehension skills
2. **PIRF** (Pronunciation, Intonation, Rhythm, Flow) for learning how to speak like an American
3. **AE** (Action English) for advanced students who need to master speaking “naturally”.
4. **LME WEEKLY**—a combination of DDM and PIRF.

**What is YOUR goal?** That’s the first thing you need to answer.

Some students **don’t really have a specific goal**—they just want to improve. In that case, I definitely recommend DDM.

Some students feel that they are **beginners**—in that case I would recommend LME WEEKLY.

Some students are **frustrated with their speaking**—they can never remember the right words, they say UHHH too much—in that case I would recommend DDM VIP, PIRF VIP and AE.

Some students want to **“clean up” their pronunciation** and they want to **sound like an American**—absolutely take PIRF!

**Our classes are NOT for “beginners”.** But if you can read an email like this and understand 80%+ without a dictionary, then you are definitely ready to start with us.

**You will NOT master a language in 2 months.** Not in 6 months. It takes a long time. You will improve a lot…then a little…then nothing…then improve a little…then a lot… **That’s the cycle of learning.** But while you study, don’t you want to ENJOY studying?

I made my COURSES as **fun** **😊** as possible so students don’t get **bored** ☹! Every lesson is different—and we have almost 800 lessons!!!! Right now I’m working on DDM 583 and PIRF 214! That’s 797 lessons! WOW!

**Do you have time?**

If yes, **get VIP** classes. VIP classes offer a lot of bonus lessons and a HUGE number of LIVE classes.

**Are you super busy?**

**Get WEEKLY** classes. They offer one lesson every week and a several LIVE classes you can join, too.

**If you don’t have much money?** Definitely **join our WEEKLY**classes. They are very inexpensive, and the lessons are **TOP NOTCH!**

That’s it for today, have a SUPER 4th of July!
