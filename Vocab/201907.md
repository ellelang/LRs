**TO LEARN: right around the corner, Little League, anniversary, a federal holiday, gets the day off, sparklers, bottle rockets, firecrackers, display**

Americana Monday!

Independence Day is **right around the corner** *(coming very soon)*—it’s this Thursday! Independence Day is considered the USA’s birthday! And this Thursday will be our 243rd birthday!

Wow…that suddenly makes me feel really old because I remember when it was America’s 200th birthday~ I was in **Little League***(baseball for very young boys)* and we played a special 4th of July tournament~!!

- tournament: a sporting competition in which contestants play a series of games to decide the winner

July 4th, 1776 is the **anniversary** *(birthday)* of our Declaration of Independence from England—when we told the King of England that we were INDEPENDENT! It’s **a federal holiday** *(a US government holiday)* and almost everyone **gets the day off** *(doesn’t have to work)*! This year, it’s on a Thursday so MILLIONS of people will take Thursday AND Friday AND the weekend off! That means MILLIONS of people will be traveling during the holiday to enjoy some summer weather!

Fireworks are a BIG thing during the 4th. Each state has different laws about fireworks. Things like **sparklers** *(first picture)* are legal in every state, but **bottle rockets** *(second picture)* and **firecrackers***(third picture)* are illegal in many states. I don’t buy any fireworks, but when Mikey is older I will!

Of course, public fireworks are the best. Most towns and cities have a large **display** *(showing)*. The best displays are over the water. If you have a boat, you are guaranteed a terrific view of the fireworks.

Camping, barbecues, parades, fireworks and swimming are MUST DOs during this summer holiday. And, personally, it’s also a really good time for Americans to think about “what it means to be an American”.

Does your country have an Independence Day? When is it AND send us pictures of how you celebrate it!

A quick recap: **right around the corner, Little League, anniversary, a federal holiday, gets the day off, sparklers, bottle rockets, firecrackers, display**

That’s it for today, have a SUPER 2nd half of 2019!
