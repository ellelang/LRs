**TO LEARN: right around the corner, Little League, anniversary, a federal holiday, gets the day off, sparklers, bottle rockets, firecrackers, display**

Americana Monday!

Independence Day is **right around the corner** *(coming very soon)*—it’s this Thursday! Independence Day is considered the USA’s birthday! And this Thursday will be our 243rd birthday!

Wow…that suddenly makes me feel really old because I remember when it was America’s 200th birthday~ I was in **Little League***(baseball for very young boys)* and we played a special 4th of July tournament~!!

- tournament: a sporting competition in which contestants play a series of games to decide the winner

July 4th, 1776 is the **anniversary** *(birthday)* of our Declaration of Independence from England—when we told the King of England that we were INDEPENDENT! It’s **a federal holiday** *(a US government holiday)* and almost everyone **gets the day off** *(doesn’t have to work)*! This year, it’s on a Thursday so MILLIONS of people will take Thursday AND Friday AND the weekend off! That means MILLIONS of people will be traveling during the holiday to enjoy some summer weather!

Fireworks are a BIG thing during the 4th. Each state has different laws about fireworks. Things like **sparklers** *(first picture)* are legal in every state, but **bottle rockets** *(second picture)* and **firecrackers***(third picture)* are illegal in many states. I don’t buy any fireworks, but when Mikey is older I will!

Of course, public fireworks are the best. Most towns and cities have a large **display** *(showing)*. The best displays are over the water. If you have a boat, you are guaranteed a terrific view of the fireworks.

Camping, barbecues, parades, fireworks and swimming are MUST DOs during this summer holiday. And, personally, it’s also a really good time for Americans to think about “what it means to be an American”.

Does your country have an Independence Day? When is it AND send us pictures of how you celebrate it!

A quick recap: **right around the corner, Little League, anniversary, a federal holiday, gets the day off, sparklers, bottle rockets, firecrackers, display**

That’s it for today, have a SUPER 2nd half of 2019!

Sometimes strangers are kinder  than your own family and friends.

And sometimes we're kinder to strangers than we are to our own family and friends.


That's the way we are. Most of us. But I know we all agree: We should be nicest to our friends and family!

The reason is...comfort.

We feel comfortable around family and friends. Our minds relax. We are...natural. And that's a nice thing.

BUT...

Don't allow "natural" to become "complacent".

Complacency means that we have become comfortable--too comfortable--and we lose that desire to improve anything. Everything is "good" or at least "good enough".

Complacency is NOT a good thing.

Are you complacent anywhere in your life? Get out of that comfort zone and find a way to make yourself uncomfortable. That will force you to make improvement!

Start with your family and friends. Say something nice. Do something nice. Make sure they know that they really are your number one priority!

Let's check out OUR family's pictures...

Hi Shane 

Here are my answers!

I am having my dinner on my holiday and 

I didn't bring my laptop 

so I write the answers on napkin and then took a picture with my phone!! 

Have a good day.

 

I love it!! DDM on a napkin! On vacation! In such a beautiful place!! The dinner table looks fantastic with such a wonderful view!

What was for dinner? What did you do on vacation?

37°C/98°F in the sun is a very perfect time for selling lemonade!


In the picture: my daughter and her friend at their lemonade stand with one of their customers.

Your daughter is an entrepreneur! I wish I could run over there and buy a big glass of lemonade. BUT IT'S TOO HOT!! I heard, however, that this week in Europe it's much cooler. Is that true? 

 What will your daughter do with her riches? Save it? Spend it? Reinvest it? Tell me!!

Hi Shane. Monday, May 20th. 
Another week, another state. We leave Cape Cod, Massachusetts and head west towards Upstate New York. No more ocean nor beaches, but we are discovering beautiful, wooded areas.

Our first stop is Troy, NY. It’s a pretty little town near the state capital of New York which is Albany.  Cohoes Falls in Troy, NY. Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza, Albany NY.

 Second stop: Buffalo NY and Niagara Falls.

The weather was against us. We took two big showers: the water from the falls and the water from a heavy rain. This is the final result: soaked to the skin!

Let’s go to an area more welcoming and very peaceful: Ohio. We can see that America is a land of contrasts.


Below: the countryside in Ohi

We are ending our week in Cleveland. A very nice city.


I hope that you enjoy this travel report as much as we enjoyed our trip in the US.  Have a good day.  Nour-Eddine

Hi Nour-Eddine,

It looks like you and your wife are having more and more and more fun as the trip continues!! And your descriptions are so wonderful--I think by being in the USA that your English is improving!! 

I can't wait to talk to you in DDM VIP this week and ask you questions--Which state was your favorite? Did you find a food you especially liked? Did you have any problems? What did your wife like the most? Will you come back again?

Last Sunday we were in the Festival of Dances- Global Ballet Holidays.

My middle daughter is a fan of ballerinas,

so we couldn't miss it) Take care. Gulya

Hi Gulya, Such a classical little girl! Already a fan of ballet and ballerinas? I love it! If she wants to become a dancer, will you encourage her? What about your other kids? What dreams do they have?! How exciting. By having children, we can live life again!!

To the left, a hut.

 Some tomatoes, potatoes, strawberries, onions, dill, cucumbers, a gooseberry bush, Estragon weed...

 You can see the guard dog and trashburner. Also to the right is my shed and root cellar.

 The greenhouse belongs to a neighbor!

Below:

Homemade strawberry jam which is delicious! Tutsan and linden flowers for tea...acid-free tea which is really harmless after a meal!

Hi Alex, Oh my god... Your garden looks tremendous! The entire layout is so organized and lush!! What is the guard dog protecting the garden from? Rabbits? They can be pesky little creatures! SO MUCH JAM!! How long will that last? Do you share with your neighbors? Do you sell any at the market? Barter? And homemade tea... You are living the perfect life!!!

Beer! How embarrassing after looking at Alex's garden. I'm at a Walmart getting beer and oranges. And a shirt for Mikey~

Eating lots of fast food these days...hot dogs, McDonald's, Taco John's, Subway sandwiches, Chick-fil-A...you name it! This is JUST TERRIBLE.

 To be honest, though, I've been on the road SO much. I haven't been able to enjoy my wife's cooking. I went house-hunting out east. I went to a military base to get some of my OLD records. I went to a hospital for a special checkup. Over the last 10 days, I've only had 3 days at home.

So won't be too disappointed that I've been neglecting my diet!!!

Skunk brothers... and a deer. 

Those baby skunks CAN SPRAY, but so far they've been very nice. And actually they're really cute. I'm tempted to run out and hug one!! I won't~~

Then a bear! And I'll tell you why he likes our house...our chickens. It looks like he may have gotten one. That's not good. The last thing you want around your house is a bear!

Mosquitoes are no good, too! Mosquitoes are really bad where I live! If you don't protect yourself, they'll be on you in a second! You MUST NOT be complacent where I live. All be vigilant. Never be comfortable. Always be ready to move and conquer!!

 The same goes for your English, right?!

- vigilant:  carefully observant or attentive; on the lookout for possible danger

### LME 121

**TO LEARN: Which course should I take? Goals, Time, Money**

Which class should I take?

I get this question a LOT and I’ve answered it a few times. But let’s cover it again.

We have four different COURSES.

1. **DDM** (Daily Dictation Members) for improving your listening and comprehension skills
2. **PIRF** (Pronunciation, Intonation, Rhythm, Flow) for learning how to speak like an American
3. **AE** (Action English) for advanced students who need to master speaking “naturally”.
4. **LME WEEKLY**—a combination of DDM and PIRF.

**What is YOUR goal?** That’s the first thing you need to answer.

Some students **don’t really have a specific goal**—they just want to improve. In that case, I definitely recommend DDM.

Some students feel that they are **beginners**—in that case I would recommend LME WEEKLY.

Some students are **frustrated with their speaking**—they can never remember the right words, they say UHHH too much—in that case I would recommend DDM VIP, PIRF VIP and AE.

Some students want to **“clean up” their pronunciation** and they want to **sound like an American**—absolutely take PIRF!

**Our classes are NOT for “beginners”.** But if you can read an email like this and understand 80%+ without a dictionary, then you are definitely ready to start with us.

**You will NOT master a language in 2 months.** Not in 6 months. It takes a long time. You will improve a lot…then a little…then nothing…then improve a little…then a lot… **That’s the cycle of learning.** But while you study, don’t you want to ENJOY studying?

I made my COURSES as **fun** **😊** as possible so students don’t get **bored** ☹! Every lesson is different—and we have almost 800 lessons!!!! Right now I’m working on DDM 583 and PIRF 214! That’s 797 lessons! WOW!

**Do you have time?**

If yes, **get VIP** classes. VIP classes offer a lot of bonus lessons and a HUGE number of LIVE classes.

**Are you super busy?**

**Get WEEKLY** classes. They offer one lesson every week and a several LIVE classes you can join, too.

**If you don’t have much money?** Definitely **join our WEEKLY**classes. They are very inexpensive, and the lessons are **TOP NOTCH!**

That’s it for today, have a SUPER 4th of July!

Hi ,

*I’m a DAY behind! I know—I’ll catch up!! Phrasal Verb Friday tomorrow (on Saturday!!).*

I am NOT a grammar teacher. But when I coach my students, sometimes I have to become one. Ugh…it’s no fun!!

But I try.

So, we had a great question about these two patterns:

- He could not have…NEVER HAD

**Versus:**

He could not have **had**…he HAD—and it was the **best**! 

- I should not have…I should NEVER HAVE

**Versus:**

I should not have **had**…I **HAD**—but I shouldn’t have!

- I would not have…I would NEVER HAVE

**Versus:**

I would not have **had**…I DID HAVE—I was **lucky**!

- I might not have…I probably will NEVER HAVE

**Versus:**

I might not have **had**…I DID HAVE—I was **lucky**!

 

**So, looking at those sentences again:**

He could not have had success. -->  He did have success and it was amazing and only those circumstances allowed him to have success.**😊**

He could not have success. -->  He tried but was never successful.**☹**

I should not have had that extra piece of cake. -->  I ate TOO MUCH cake!! I’m happy but fat!! **😊**

I should not have that extra piece of cake. -->  I will stop now—I do not want to eat too much cake. I’m skinny but still hungry **☹**

I would not have had a son. -->  I was lucky and had a son! I’m happy! **😊**

I would not have a son. -->  Although I wanted a son, I never had one~**☹**

I might not have had success. -->  Thanks to that situation, I DID have success! **😊**

I might not have success. -->  I probably will not have success ~**☹**

NOW...you need to make your own sentences. Without practice, you'll never learn. If you're in my AMA class tomorrow, let's practice together!

Grammar is a **PAIN IN THE ASS**! But…it’s a necessary evil. To communicate effectively, we DO need to know how to use it. And by studying with us, you can learn HOW to use grammar EFFECTIVELY. And you get to learn with me, which means it’s fun and easy! JOIN US!

A quick recap: **could not have** **VS** **could not have had**

### LME 123

**TO LEARN: called upon**

When I was about 15 years old, I was **called upon** *(formally requested—asked to do something)* by my family to volunteer for military service. I came from a family of freedom fighters. My early American ancestors fought in the Revolutionary War, they fought for the Union Army *(the North—anti-slavery)* in the Civil War, they fought in World War I, my grandfather fought in World War II *(the Battle of the Bulge)* and my father was a combat medic during the Vietnam War. So, I felt that I had to volunteer for the Army.

When I joined, there were no conflicts *(wars)*—that was good. And after serving for a few years, the Army would help pay for my college education—that was great!

But towards the end of my military career, a problem erupted in the Middle East. Fortunately, I was not **called upon** to serve in battle. But my friend was. My high school friend Brian Scott. He was a great guy—very funny and very kind. He lost his life in Iraq in 1991. There's a story about him—if you click the picture below, you can read it. They talk about Brian at the end of the story.

Amazingly, before he was killed, he called MY MILITARY UNIT! I worked in communications, and part of my job was connecting combat soldiers to their family members so that they could say “Hi!”

My job was taking the soldier’s battlefield radio calls and connecting them to US telephone lines. I worked 15 hour shifts three days a week. I worked Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Brian called on a Tuesday—I just missed his call!

Less than one month later, Brian was killed.

He died before meeting his new baby boy.

I went to Brian’s funeral and it was one of the saddest days of my life. It still brings tears to my eyes. If you have ever seen a military funeral… You’d never forget it. So much sadness and so much honor.

I hope you are NEVER **called upon** to serve your country in battle. Your sons and daughters, too. It’s much better to serve your country in other ways.

Maybe you’ll be **called upon** to educate youth, to assist the elderly, to feed the homeless, to serve in your religious community. Maybe you’ll simply be **called upon** to raise a wonderful, loving, strong family.

The other day was July 4th. The USA’s birthday. The USA, in my opinion, stands for freedom. We have made a lot of mistakes, but the average American really believes in freedom. And we want freedom. Not just for us, but for everyone around the world, too.

I want to thank everyone who believes in freedom. All around the world. And a HUGE thank you to all the brave men and women who have fought for freedom. Especially to those who have died for freedom. All around the world.

Sorry for the heavy letter! I felt “**called upon**” to write a tribute to my friend Brian Scott on America’s birthday.

A quick recap: **called upon**

My best to you! 😊

**TO LEARN: swing for the fences, struck out looking, struck out swinging, on deck, ground balls, knock it out of the park**

Americana Monday. IF you ever visit the USA in the late spring, summer, early fall; I highly recommend that you attend a professional baseball game! Even if you don’t know the rules, it can be fun! Especially if the weather is nice.

The food is great. Hot dogs and beer are what I recommend. The perfect baseball combination!!

The music is great! The fans know all the songs and the cheering music! And they play the music on a REAL organ LIVE!!

 And if you go in the evening—or as they say “twilight”, the atmosphere is really the best! Especially if the home team wins!

And baseball is such a big part of the United States. We have SO many expressions that come from baseball. Let me teach you a few, okay?

**Swing for the fences**

In baseball: try and hit a home run! Try and hit the baseball OUT of the stadium!

In life: Do your best and try and achieve something really amazing!

If you’re going to study English, swing for the fences. Master it!

**Struck out looking**

In baseball: you were unsuccessful at hitting the ball EVEN THOUGH the pitches were good. You really failed.

In life: you were unable to be successful at something because you were TOO careful or TOO lazy

Wow. You could have had that job at Apple. But you never applied. You only talked about it. Now someone else has that great job. You were struck out looking~

**Struck out swinging**

In baseball: you were unsuccessful BUT you tried your best. Good job—try again next time.

In life: same thing!

Hey, it’s too bad you didn’t get the job with Apple. But at least you tried. At least you struck out swinging. Apple made a mistake by not hiring you. You’ll get an even better job. Go for it!

**On deck**

In baseball: the next person to bat

In life: the next person!

Speaking right now is Coach Arthur and on deck is Coach Shane.

**Ground balls**

In baseball: when you hit the ball “safely” and get on base.

In life: when you do something safely…but it’s BORING!

Since Steve Jobs died, Apple is just hitting ground balls. They have nice products, but no home runs. They need to knock it out of the park if they want to remain on the best.

**Knock it out of the park**

In baseball: hit a homerun! The BEST hit in baseball.

In life: do something super successfully!

After moving back to the USA, Coach Shane has been knocking them out of the park. He started a business teaching online, he got married, he has a son! And there’s more to come. Hard work is finally paying off for him!

Oh! It’s true and THANK YOU!

There are MANY more baseball-related expressions and I know that I will be teaching more in the future—especially in my DDM and PIRF classes. You should join us!

 

By the way, I want to say a HUGE thank you to Coach Arthur. He has been with the LME team for several years—but his time to move on has come. He has been offered an excellent job and it will require his full attention. Coach Arthur, thank you SO much for being a part of our time and enriching the lives of so many DDM students. You will be missed, Coach. Best of luck to you in the future and I hope our paths will cross one day.

A quick recap: **swing for the fences, struck out looking, struck out swinging, on deck, ground balls, knock it out of the park**

So many questions and never enough answers. But THAT is the essence of learning.

Once we stop asking questions, we stop learning.

I teach English. I'm VERY good at English!! But in order to be better, I have LIVE classes with my students. In those classes, they ask me questions about EVERYTHING!!

They ALWAYS make me think and make me study.

QUESTIONS...

Do you want to become a MASTER at something?

The route to becoming a master can be found in the questions that you ask!



Hi Coach Shane,
I wanted to share with you and everyone where I have been and what I’ve been doing.

My job is rehearsing operas on the piano in theaters. I’m an assistant conductor. After several weeks of piano rehearsals, rehearsals with the orchestra follow until the performances.

I love my job and fortunately I get to travel a lot, too.


Recently I went to Mérida, Spain, a small city where Roman buildings are still maintained after 2000 years. It's easy to imagine the sound of the Roman soldiers' footsteps and their armor jangling.

The opera we were producing was Camille Saint-Saëns’ “Samson et Dalila”. For the first week, we rehearsed in Barcelona.

For the second week, we went to Mérida. 
This city was founded before Jesus was born! And the Roman Theater, where we had our performances, was built in the first century! TOUCHING the marble columns and the old stones was just an indescribable sensation! Were the Romans acting? Or their slaves? What kinds of shows did they have? Moreover, how did the audiences react? Was their enthusiasm loud & noisy?

The special thing was that around 350 people were acting on the stage. 80% of them were just regular people who had never seen an opera, and 25% of them were physically or mentally disabled.

The stage director wanted them representing the folks being suppressed by political power and military. With this opera, in two words, he wanted to **acclaim the extinguishing of wars and injustice, and claim for humanity and love.**

We also had excellent opera singers, a choir and orchestra. We ended up having a huge success each performance evening.

I have to say that each night I was deeply touched when I saw “normal and disabled” people giving all their spirit on the stage. This event might be a unique experience for all of them, but for us it was very emotional, too. It brought us back down to Earth.

For me, the best part though, was the participation of the sweet and strong creature, representing **Divinity**. “Duende” enjoyed acting for the audience and loved the applause!

Hi Husan!  

What a fantastic story and beautiful pictures! You did a super job at describing your wonderful adventure and we hope to get more from you, too!

 Just reading the story was touching! Thank you!!



- Hello, Coach Shane. You know that I am now in Egypt. Last month the bridge Long live Egypt opened and I wanted to share some photos with you. I hope you like them.

 The "Long Live Egypt" bridge, built in Cairo, entered the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's largest bridge (67 meters and 36 cm). It includes 6 traffic lanes in each direction. It's (540) meters long and (96) meters above the surface of the water.

 To drive across this bridge costs 20 Egyptian pounds, around U$1.20.

Hi Mahmoud! 

 I LOVE new construction and since you're an architect, I can imagine that you love it even more than me!! But I'm curious--you are already an established architect. Why did you go back to learn more? Are you trying to change specialties?

 And how do you like being back in Egypt? And...are there local stories that describe the origin of the **Pyramids and the Sphinx** differently than what modern science tells us? I'm really curious!!

If I ever go to Egypt, it would be an honor to have you show me around! 

 

Dear Coach Shane,

I am watching your videos. I learn English every day by your email. It helps me improve my English and relax after work

Thank you so much my Coach!

I took photo with a baby sheep, it is so cute -_-, It is also my screen desktop in my office

This is a jar of lavender which I made. My favorite flower is lavender. I make these to sell in my free time. What do you think about it?

I look forward to hearing about your new house. I enclosed 3 pictures of my parent's new house!

Hi Hahn My! 

Great pictures--all of them! That lamb is SUPER cute! The spring and early summer are the best because all the animals have their babies! 

Lavender is very popular and I'll bet your side business of selling those decorations does nicely! Does lavender grow near your home?

And congratulations to your parents on their new home! It looks really nice and it has a great view! We are still hoping to get our own home--our first home--soon! Only time will tell!!

Thanks for the excellent photos!

   "Summer Solstice Solo camping & kayaking

   S-cubed camping & kayaking!!

(Inspired by CS)

 A couple or so years ago I was up for a solo camping/ kayaking trip. But year after year I delayed it for one or another stupid reasons. This year the thought occurred to me again. Hmm..time goes only in one way and the clock doesn't stop ticking.

So, I said to myself: 'Come on! What am I waiting for? It's just a little paddling for fun. Seventy kilometers down a river? It's easy!'

Of course, I am not as good as I once was, but I'm still good once as I ever was. I chose the symbolic time, place and weather for that adventure. It was the day of the summer solstice, the paddling launched from Solnzevo town (the name could be interpreted as Sun's) on a hot sunny day. Sun and the letters S are everywhere!

Hi Alex, 

S-cubed is PERFECT! Your adventure looks absolutely wonderful and I'm super impressed--70 kilometers ALL by yourself! 

My question, I have many but my burning question:

You go down the river in one direction 70 kilometers...

HOW do you get home?! 

Was one night enough? Did you fish? What did you eat? Did  you purify water or bring it? Did you have a radio or a smartphone with you? Did you run into any animals? Strange people? Other kayakers? When's your next trip?!!

-  Finally, from Coach Shane...

Starting with a local taco truck... (VERY overpriced and NOT tasty)

Moving on to a cheap hot dog (A buck fifty including the coke with free refills) 

Hit up a different taco place but FORGOT to get salsa~

(Slightly better tasting and much cheaper)

Finally a chicken sandwich from another very popular fast food joint~

(Priced okay but NOT tasty at all) 

Finally, washed down ALL that garbage fast food with homemade lemonade. WOW! It's extra sour and has a real KICK!! I've been on the road SO MUCH the past several weeks... Ugh, give me homemade food ANY DAY OF THE WEEK!!!

Mikey and I were out doing some errands. He's getting heavy, but I cherish these days. I know in a few years, he will NOT want me to pick him up. And in a few more years, I won't be able to pick him up because he'll be too heavy!!!

We had a **vicious** windstorm last night. One of our neighbors lost part of his roof on his pole barn. Nobody was hurt, but it's going to cost him a lot of money to fix his building. He just finished building it last year, too. Mother Nature can be **cruel**!

That's it for this week! Stay happy and healthy and STAY AWAY from junk food!!

And don't forget: Ask QUESTIONS and become a Master, okay?

**TO LEARN: every day, everyday**

 

Hi , Wednesday’s Word Wisdom

In English, there are MANY confusing things, and today let’s focus on something that confuses ESL people like you AND native speakers like me!

- Every day V.S. Everyday

“**every day**” as two words means DAILY or EACH DAY! Every Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday … To help you remember, “every other day” means, for example, Monday and Wednesday and Friday… Use it as an ADVERB!

“**everyday**” as one word means REGULAR. Something you might see/do/read anywhere and everywhere. It’s nothing special! Use it as an ADJECTIVE!

Let’s look at the sentences again. How’d you do? 100%?!

- My **everyday** lunch consists of a sandwich and a glass of milk.
- I eat my lunch **every day** at 12:30.
- He calls me **every day**.
- Answering phone calls is an **everyday** task for me.
- I live in the country, so seeing wild animals is an **everyday** experience. I see them **every day**.

To master little things like these, you need to practice EVERY DAY! And if you are a member of DDM or PIRF or LME WEEKLY, learning stuff like this is an EVERYDAY thing!

**A quick recap: every day, everyday**

**TO LEARN: believe, lover, friend, trust, life**

 

Thursday’s Say Somethings…

Languages are great. And learning how to “play games” with languages and with words is a lot of fun! **IF** you like languages~

I do!

I have an example for you today.

Here are five common words that I am sure you know:

- **Believe**
- **Lover**
- **Friend**
- **Trust**
- **Life**

Easy, right?

Well, here’s the “fun”.

These five words are very meaningful words. But many people use these words “too freely”. Each of these words contains another word which you might want to remember the next time you use them!

- There is always a LIE in **believe**. Be careful of what you believe!
- There is always an OVER in **lover**. If you don’t want your love to be over, work hard.
- There is always an END in **friend**. Like love, cherish your friends and keep them until the end!
- There is always an US in **trust**. If you want a strong relationship, you must have trust between you.
- There is always an IF in **life**. Don’t live your life always saying IF…do more. Enjoy your life more.

It’s just a game!! But sometimes these games are real😊

A quick recap: **believe, lover, friend, trust, life**

That’s it for today. I’ll be back tomorrow for Phrasal Verb Friday!

#### LTA

Q1: If you’ve ever crossed an international border, which country gave you the “hardest” time? Q2: How are your interpersonal skills?

#### EVC

- Suggesting       
-  demeanor        

People will have their opinions about you according to your DEMEANOR and your communication skills.

- abrupt       

You must be patient even with an abrupt and rude customer

-  the merits of        

The merits of building a new metro line will ease traffic congestion in the city. 

- the lion’s share

The lion's share of the work has been done by my friends.

SUGGESTING, in this case, is NOT the same as RECOMMENDING! It’s the same as IMPLYING.

So, which is more common to say:

​                I’m implying…

Or

​                Are you implying…?

Or

​                He was implying that…

The second two are very common, the first MUCH LESS common!

 

It’s BEST to use a NOUN with “the lion’s share”. For example;

The lion’s share of the work

The lion’s share of home mortgages

**TO LEARN: spring SMT on SMO, blown away, bowl over, taken aback, bring SMO down**

TGIF!

Well, today my wife and I (and Mikey, too!) got some really good news. But I can’t tell YOU. Yet!

I need to **spring this on my family**, first. They’re going to be **blown away**! The news will **bowl over** my dad! Some people might be **taken aback**, but I won’t let that **bring me down**

Did you understand that paragraph?! I used five different phrasal verbs, right? Let me rewrite that paragraph with NO phrasal verbs!

I need to tell my family about this surprising information first. They’re going to be super surprised! The news will shock my dad—but it will be a good shock! Some people might be surprised in a negative way, but I won’t let that disappoint me or make me feel depressed.

I’m guessing that the second paragraph is MUCH FRIENDLIER to ESL students! Am I right? But remember, everyone, if you want to MASTER daily English—you need to memorize PHRASAL VERBS!!

Go ahead--go back and forth over those two paragraphs and master those five phrasal verbs. USE them in your own sentences. Say them out loud. Have fun with it!

Join DDM and enjoy mastering English! We have a SPECIAL membership at the very bottom of this email—check it out!
