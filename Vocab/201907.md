**TO LEARN: right around the corner, Little League, anniversary, a federal holiday, gets the day off, sparklers, bottle rockets, firecrackers, display**

Americana Monday!

Independence Day is **right around the corner** *(coming very soon)*—it’s this Thursday! Independence Day is considered the USA’s birthday! And this Thursday will be our 243rd birthday!

Wow…that suddenly makes me feel really old because I remember when it was America’s 200th birthday~ I was in **Little League***(baseball for very young boys)* and we played a special 4th of July tournament~!!

- tournament: a sporting competition in which contestants play a series of games to decide the winner

July 4th, 1776 is the **anniversary** *(birthday)* of our Declaration of Independence from England—when we told the King of England that we were INDEPENDENT! It’s **a federal holiday** *(a US government holiday)* and almost everyone **gets the day off** *(doesn’t have to work)*! This year, it’s on a Thursday so MILLIONS of people will take Thursday AND Friday AND the weekend off! That means MILLIONS of people will be traveling during the holiday to enjoy some summer weather!

Fireworks are a BIG thing during the 4th. Each state has different laws about fireworks. Things like **sparklers** *(first picture)* are legal in every state, but **bottle rockets** *(second picture)* and **firecrackers***(third picture)* are illegal in many states. I don’t buy any fireworks, but when Mikey is older I will!

Of course, public fireworks are the best. Most towns and cities have a large **display** *(showing)*. The best displays are over the water. If you have a boat, you are guaranteed a terrific view of the fireworks.

Camping, barbecues, parades, fireworks and swimming are MUST DOs during this summer holiday. And, personally, it’s also a really good time for Americans to think about “what it means to be an American”.

Does your country have an Independence Day? When is it AND send us pictures of how you celebrate it!

A quick recap: **right around the corner, Little League, anniversary, a federal holiday, gets the day off, sparklers, bottle rockets, firecrackers, display**

That’s it for today, have a SUPER 2nd half of 2019!

Sometimes strangers are kinder  than your own family and friends.

And sometimes we're kinder to strangers than we are to our own family and friends.


That's the way we are. Most of us. But I know we all agree: We should be nicest to our friends and family!

The reason is...comfort.

We feel comfortable around family and friends. Our minds relax. We are...natural. And that's a nice thing.

BUT...

Don't allow "natural" to become "complacent".

Complacency means that we have become comfortable--too comfortable--and we lose that desire to improve anything. Everything is "good" or at least "good enough".

Complacency is NOT a good thing.

Are you complacent anywhere in your life? Get out of that comfort zone and find a way to make yourself uncomfortable. That will force you to make improvement!

Start with your family and friends. Say something nice. Do something nice. Make sure they know that they really are your number one priority!

Let's check out OUR family's pictures...

Hi Shane 

Here are my answers!

I am having my dinner on my holiday and 

I didn't bring my laptop 

so I write the answers on napkin and then took a picture with my phone!! 

Have a good day.

 

I love it!! DDM on a napkin! On vacation! In such a beautiful place!! The dinner table looks fantastic with such a wonderful view!

What was for dinner? What did you do on vacation?

37°C/98°F in the sun is a very perfect time for selling lemonade!


In the picture: my daughter and her friend at their lemonade stand with one of their customers.

Your daughter is an entrepreneur! I wish I could run over there and buy a big glass of lemonade. BUT IT'S TOO HOT!! I heard, however, that this week in Europe it's much cooler. Is that true? 

 What will your daughter do with her riches? Save it? Spend it? Reinvest it? Tell me!!

Hi Shane. Monday, May 20th. 
Another week, another state. We leave Cape Cod, Massachusetts and head west towards Upstate New York. No more ocean nor beaches, but we are discovering beautiful, wooded areas.

Our first stop is Troy, NY. It’s a pretty little town near the state capital of New York which is Albany.  Cohoes Falls in Troy, NY. Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza, Albany NY.

 Second stop: Buffalo NY and Niagara Falls.

The weather was against us. We took two big showers: the water from the falls and the water from a heavy rain. This is the final result: soaked to the skin!

Let’s go to an area more welcoming and very peaceful: Ohio. We can see that America is a land of contrasts.


Below: the countryside in Ohi

We are ending our week in Cleveland. A very nice city.


I hope that you enjoy this travel report as much as we enjoyed our trip in the US.  Have a good day.  Nour-Eddine

Hi Nour-Eddine,

It looks like you and your wife are having more and more and more fun as the trip continues!! And your descriptions are so wonderful--I think by being in the USA that your English is improving!! 

I can't wait to talk to you in DDM VIP this week and ask you questions--Which state was your favorite? Did you find a food you especially liked? Did you have any problems? What did your wife like the most? Will you come back again?

Last Sunday we were in the Festival of Dances- Global Ballet Holidays.

My middle daughter is a fan of ballerinas,

so we couldn't miss it) Take care. Gulya

Hi Gulya, Such a classical little girl! Already a fan of ballet and ballerinas? I love it! If she wants to become a dancer, will you encourage her? What about your other kids? What dreams do they have?! How exciting. By having children, we can live life again!!

To the left, a hut.

 Some tomatoes, potatoes, strawberries, onions, dill, cucumbers, a gooseberry bush, Estragon weed...

 You can see the guard dog and trashburner. Also to the right is my shed and root cellar.

 The greenhouse belongs to a neighbor!

Below:

Homemade strawberry jam which is delicious! Tutsan and linden flowers for tea...acid-free tea which is really harmless after a meal!

Hi Alex, Oh my god... Your garden looks tremendous! The entire layout is so organized and lush!! What is the guard dog protecting the garden from? Rabbits? They can be pesky little creatures! SO MUCH JAM!! How long will that last? Do you share with your neighbors? Do you sell any at the market? Barter? And homemade tea... You are living the perfect life!!!

Beer! How embarrassing after looking at Alex's garden. I'm at a Walmart getting beer and oranges. And a shirt for Mikey~

Eating lots of fast food these days...hot dogs, McDonald's, Taco John's, Subway sandwiches, Chick-fil-A...you name it! This is JUST TERRIBLE.

 To be honest, though, I've been on the road SO much. I haven't been able to enjoy my wife's cooking. I went house-hunting out east. I went to a military base to get some of my OLD records. I went to a hospital for a special checkup. Over the last 10 days, I've only had 3 days at home.

So won't be too disappointed that I've been neglecting my diet!!!

Skunk brothers... and a deer. 

Those baby skunks CAN SPRAY, but so far they've been very nice. And actually they're really cute. I'm tempted to run out and hug one!! I won't~~

Then a bear! And I'll tell you why he likes our house...our chickens. It looks like he may have gotten one. That's not good. The last thing you want around your house is a bear!

Mosquitoes are no good, too! Mosquitoes are really bad where I live! If you don't protect yourself, they'll be on you in a second! You MUST NOT be complacent where I live. All be vigilant. Never be comfortable. Always be ready to move and conquer!!

 The same goes for your English, right?!

- vigilant:  carefully observant or attentive; on the lookout for possible danger

**TO LEARN: Which course should I take? Goals, Time, Money**

Which class should I take?

I get this question a LOT and I’ve answered it a few times. But let’s cover it again.

We have four different COURSES.

1. **DDM** (Daily Dictation Members) for improving your listening and comprehension skills
2. **PIRF** (Pronunciation, Intonation, Rhythm, Flow) for learning how to speak like an American
3. **AE** (Action English) for advanced students who need to master speaking “naturally”.
4. **LME WEEKLY**—a combination of DDM and PIRF.

**What is YOUR goal?** That’s the first thing you need to answer.

Some students **don’t really have a specific goal**—they just want to improve. In that case, I definitely recommend DDM.

Some students feel that they are **beginners**—in that case I would recommend LME WEEKLY.

Some students are **frustrated with their speaking**—they can never remember the right words, they say UHHH too much—in that case I would recommend DDM VIP, PIRF VIP and AE.

Some students want to **“clean up” their pronunciation** and they want to **sound like an American**—absolutely take PIRF!

**Our classes are NOT for “beginners”.** But if you can read an email like this and understand 80%+ without a dictionary, then you are definitely ready to start with us.

**You will NOT master a language in 2 months.** Not in 6 months. It takes a long time. You will improve a lot…then a little…then nothing…then improve a little…then a lot… **That’s the cycle of learning.** But while you study, don’t you want to ENJOY studying?

I made my COURSES as **fun** **😊** as possible so students don’t get **bored** ☹! Every lesson is different—and we have almost 800 lessons!!!! Right now I’m working on DDM 583 and PIRF 214! That’s 797 lessons! WOW!

**Do you have time?**

If yes, **get VIP** classes. VIP classes offer a lot of bonus lessons and a HUGE number of LIVE classes.

**Are you super busy?**

**Get WEEKLY** classes. They offer one lesson every week and a several LIVE classes you can join, too.

**If you don’t have much money?** Definitely **join our WEEKLY**classes. They are very inexpensive, and the lessons are **TOP NOTCH!**

That’s it for today, have a SUPER 4th of July!

Hi ,

*I’m a DAY behind! I know—I’ll catch up!! Phrasal Verb Friday tomorrow (on Saturday!!).*

I am NOT a grammar teacher. But when I coach my students, sometimes I have to become one. Ugh…it’s no fun!!

But I try.

So, we had a great question about these two patterns:

- He could not have…NEVER HAD

**Versus:**

He could not have **had**…he HAD—and it was the **best**! 

- I should not have…I should NEVER HAVE

**Versus:**

I should not have **had**…I **HAD**—but I shouldn’t have!

- I would not have…I would NEVER HAVE

**Versus:**

I would not have **had**…I DID HAVE—I was **lucky**!

- I might not have…I probably will NEVER HAVE

**Versus:**

I might not have **had**…I DID HAVE—I was **lucky**!

 

**So, looking at those sentences again:**

He could not have had success. -->  He did have success and it was amazing and only those circumstances allowed him to have success.**😊**

He could not have success. -->  He tried but was never successful.**☹**

I should not have had that extra piece of cake. -->  I ate TOO MUCH cake!! I’m happy but fat!! **😊**

I should not have that extra piece of cake. -->  I will stop now—I do not want to eat too much cake. I’m skinny but still hungry **☹**

I would not have had a son. -->  I was lucky and had a son! I’m happy! **😊**

I would not have a son. -->  Although I wanted a son, I never had one~**☹**

I might not have had success. -->  Thanks to that situation, I DID have success! **😊**

I might not have success. -->  I probably will not have success ~**☹**

NOW...you need to make your own sentences. Without practice, you'll never learn. If you're in my AMA class tomorrow, let's practice together!

Grammar is a **PAIN IN THE ASS**! But…it’s a necessary evil. To communicate effectively, we DO need to know how to use it. And by studying with us, you can learn HOW to use grammar EFFECTIVELY. And you get to learn with me, which means it’s fun and easy! JOIN US!

A quick recap: **could not have** **VS** **could not have had**

### LME 123

**TO LEARN: called upon**

When I was about 15 years old, I was **called upon** *(formally requested—asked to do something)* by my family to volunteer for military service. I came from a family of freedom fighters. My early American ancestors fought in the Revolutionary War, they fought for the Union Army *(the North—anti-slavery)* in the Civil War, they fought in World War I, my grandfather fought in World War II *(the Battle of the Bulge)* and my father was a combat medic during the Vietnam War. So, I felt that I had to volunteer for the Army.

When I joined, there were no conflicts *(wars)*—that was good. And after serving for a few years, the Army would help pay for my college education—that was great!

But towards the end of my military career, a problem erupted in the Middle East. Fortunately, I was not **called upon** to serve in battle. But my friend was. My high school friend Brian Scott. He was a great guy—very funny and very kind. He lost his life in Iraq in 1991. There's a story about him—if you click the picture below, you can read it. They talk about Brian at the end of the story.

Amazingly, before he was killed, he called MY MILITARY UNIT! I worked in communications, and part of my job was connecting combat soldiers to their family members so that they could say “Hi!”

My job was taking the soldier’s battlefield radio calls and connecting them to US telephone lines. I worked 15 hour shifts three days a week. I worked Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Brian called on a Tuesday—I just missed his call!

Less than one month later, Brian was killed.

He died before meeting his new baby boy.

I went to Brian’s funeral and it was one of the saddest days of my life. It still brings tears to my eyes. If you have ever seen a military funeral… You’d never forget it. So much sadness and so much honor.

I hope you are NEVER **called upon** to serve your country in battle. Your sons and daughters, too. It’s much better to serve your country in other ways.

Maybe you’ll be **called upon** to educate youth, to assist the elderly, to feed the homeless, to serve in your religious community. Maybe you’ll simply be **called upon** to raise a wonderful, loving, strong family.

The other day was July 4th. The USA’s birthday. The USA, in my opinion, stands for freedom. We have made a lot of mistakes, but the average American really believes in freedom. And we want freedom. Not just for us, but for everyone around the world, too.

I want to thank everyone who believes in freedom. All around the world. And a HUGE thank you to all the brave men and women who have fought for freedom. Especially to those who have died for freedom. All around the world.

Sorry for the heavy letter! I felt “**called upon**” to write a tribute to my friend Brian Scott on America’s birthday.

A quick recap: **called upon**

My best to you! 😊

**TO LEARN: swing for the fences, struck out looking, struck out swinging, on deck, ground balls, knock it out of the park**

Americana Monday. IF you ever visit the USA in the late spring, summer, early fall; I highly recommend that you attend a professional baseball game! Even if you don’t know the rules, it can be fun! Especially if the weather is nice.

The food is great. Hot dogs and beer are what I recommend. The perfect baseball combination!!

The music is great! The fans know all the songs and the cheering music! And they play the music on a REAL organ LIVE!!

 And if you go in the evening—or as they say “twilight”, the atmosphere is really the best! Especially if the home team wins!

And baseball is such a big part of the United States. We have SO many expressions that come from baseball. Let me teach you a few, okay?

**Swing for the fences**

In baseball: try and hit a home run! Try and hit the baseball OUT of the stadium!

In life: Do your best and try and achieve something really amazing!

If you’re going to study English, swing for the fences. Master it!

**Struck out looking**

In baseball: you were unsuccessful at hitting the ball EVEN THOUGH the pitches were good. You really failed.

In life: you were unable to be successful at something because you were TOO careful or TOO lazy

Wow. You could have had that job at Apple. But you never applied. You only talked about it. Now someone else has that great job. You were struck out looking~

**Struck out swinging**

In baseball: you were unsuccessful BUT you tried your best. Good job—try again next time.

In life: same thing!

Hey, it’s too bad you didn’t get the job with Apple. But at least you tried. At least you struck out swinging. Apple made a mistake by not hiring you. You’ll get an even better job. Go for it!

**On deck**

In baseball: the next person to bat

In life: the next person!

Speaking right now is Coach Arthur and on deck is Coach Shane.

**Ground balls**

In baseball: when you hit the ball “safely” and get on base.

In life: when you do something safely…but it’s BORING!

Since Steve Jobs died, Apple is just hitting ground balls. They have nice products, but no home runs. They need to knock it out of the park if they want to remain on the best.

**Knock it out of the park**

In baseball: hit a homerun! The BEST hit in baseball.

In life: do something super successfully!

After moving back to the USA, Coach Shane has been knocking them out of the park. He started a business teaching online, he got married, he has a son! And there’s more to come. Hard work is finally paying off for him!

Oh! It’s true and THANK YOU!

There are MANY more baseball-related expressions and I know that I will be teaching more in the future—especially in my DDM and PIRF classes. You should join us!

 

By the way, I want to say a HUGE thank you to Coach Arthur. He has been with the LME team for several years—but his time to move on has come. He has been offered an excellent job and it will require his full attention. Coach Arthur, thank you SO much for being a part of our time and enriching the lives of so many DDM students. You will be missed, Coach. Best of luck to you in the future and I hope our paths will cross one day.

A quick recap: **swing for the fences****,** **struck out looking****,** **struck out swinging****,** **on deck****,** **ground balls****,** **knock it out of the park**
